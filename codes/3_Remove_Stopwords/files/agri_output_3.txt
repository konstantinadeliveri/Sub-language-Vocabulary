agriculture is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock
agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities
the history of agriculture began thousands of years ago
after gathering wild grains beginning at least  years ago nascent farmers began to plant them around  years ago
pigs sheep and cattle were domesticated over  years ago
plants were independently cultivated in at least  regions of the world
industrial agriculture based on largescale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output though about  billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture
the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuels and raw materials such as rubber
food classes include cereals grains vegetables fruits oils meat milk eggs and fungi
over onethird of the worlds workers are employed in agriculture second only to the service sector although in recent decades the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues especially in developing countries where smallholding is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization that brings an enormous crop yield increase
modern agronomy plant breeding agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields but causing ecological and environmental damage
selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage
environmental issues include contributions to global warming depletion of aquifers deforestation antibiotic resistance and growth hormones in industrial meat production
agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation such as biodiversity loss desertification soil degradation and global warming all of which can cause decreases in crop yield
genetically modified organisms are widely used although some are banned in certain countries
the word agriculture is a late middle english adaptation of latin agricultūra from ager field and cultūra cultivation or growing
while agriculture usually refers to human activities certain species of ant termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to  million years
agriculture is defined with varying scopes in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life including food fiber forest products horticultural crops and their related services
thus defined it includes arable farming horticulture animal husbandry and forestry but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded
the development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering
agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included a diverse range of taxa in at least  separate centres of origin
wild grains were collected and eaten from at least  years ago
from around  years ago the eight neolithic founder crops emmer and einkorn wheat hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax were cultivated in the levant
rice was domesticated in china between  and  bc with the earliest known cultivation from  bc followed by mung soy and azuki beans
sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between  and  years ago
cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan some  years ago
pig production emerged in eurasia including europe east asia and southwest asia where wild boar were first domesticated about  years ago
in the andes of south america the potato was domesticated between  and  years ago along with beans coca llamas alpacas and guinea pigs
sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around  years ago
sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by  years ago
cotton was domesticated in peru by  years ago and was independently domesticated in eurasia
in mesoamerica wild teosinte was bred into maize by  years ago
scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture
studies of the transition from huntergatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism examples are the natufian culture in the levant and the early chinese neolithic in china
then wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted and gradually came to be domesticated
in eurasia the sumerians started to live in villages from about  bc relying on the tigris and euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation
ploughs appear in pictographs around  bc seedploughs around  bc
farmers grew wheat barley vegetables such as lentils and onions and fruits including dates grapes and figs
ancient egyptian agriculture relied on the nile river and its seasonal flooding
farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the paleolithic after  bc
staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus
in india wheat barley and jujube were domesticated by  bc soon followed by sheep and goats
cattle sheep and goats were domesticated in mehrgarh culture by   bc
cotton was cultivated by the th th millennium bc
archeological evidence indicates an animaldrawn plough from  bc in the indus valley civilisation
in china from the th century bc there was a nationwide granary system and widespread silk farming
waterpowered grain mills were in use by the st century bc followed by irrigation
by the late nd century heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards
these spread westwards across eurasia
asian rice was domesticated   years ago depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used on the pearl river in southern china with a single genetic origin from the wild rice oryza rufipogon
in greece and rome the major cereals were wheat emmer and barley alongside vegetables including peas beans and olives
sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products
in the americas crops domesticated in mesoamerica apart from teosinte include squash beans and cacao
cocoa was being domesticated by the mayo chinchipe of the upper amazon around  bc
the turkey was probably domesticated in mexico or the american southwest
the aztecs developed irrigation systems formed terraced hillsides fertilized their soil and developed chinampas or artificial islands
the mayas used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland from  bc
coca was domesticated in the andes as were the peanut tomato tobacco and pineapple
cotton was domesticated in peru by  bc
animals including llamas alpacas and guinea pigs were domesticated there
in north america the indigenous people of the east domesticated crops such as sunflower tobacco squash and chenopodium
wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested
the domesticated strawberry is a hybrid of a chilean and a north american species developed by breeding in europe and north america
the indigenous people of the southwest and the pacific northwest practiced forest gardening and firestick farming
the natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a lowintensity fire ecology that sustained a lowdensity agriculture in loose rotation a sort of wild permaculture
a system of companion planting called the three sisters was developed in north america
the three crops were winter squash maize and climbing beans
indigenous australians long supposed to have been nomadic huntergatherers practised systematic burning possibly to enhance natural productivity in firestick farming
scholars have pointed out that huntergatherers need a productive environment to support gathering without cultivation
because the forests of new guinea have few food plants early humans may have used selective burning to increase the productivity of the wild karuka fruit trees to support the huntergatherer way of life
the gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and fish trapping systems from some  years ago
there is evidence of intensification across the whole continent over that period
in two regions of australia the central west coast and eastern central early farmers cultivated yams native millet and bush onions possibly in permanent settlements
in the middle ages both in europe and in the islamic world agriculture transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants including the introduction of sugar rice cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to europe by way of alandalus
after  the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize potatoes tomatoes sweet potatoes and manioc to europe and old world crops such as wheat barley rice and turnips and livestock including horses cattle sheep and goats to the americas
irrigation crop rotation and fertilizers advanced from the th century with the british agricultural revolution allowing global population to rise significantly
since  agriculture in developed nations and to a lesser extent in the developing world has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor and assisted by synthetic fertilizers pesticides and selective breeding
the haberbosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further increase in global population
modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological political and economic issues including water pollution biofuels genetically modified organisms tariffs and farm subsidies leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement
pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals
in nomadic pastoralism herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture fodder and water
this type of farming is practised in arid and semiarid regions of sahara central asia and some parts of india
in shifting cultivation a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees
the cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile and the area is abandoned
another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated
this type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly
this practice is used in northeast india southeast asia and the amazon basin
subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone with little left over for transport elsewhere
it is intensively practiced in monsoon asia and southeast asia
an estimated  billion subsistence farmers worked in  cultivating about  of the earths arable land
intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs water fertilizer pesticide and automation
it is practiced mainly in developed countries
from the twentieth century intensive agriculture increased productivity
it substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour but caused increased water pollution and often involved farm subsidies
in recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture resulting in the organic regenerative and sustainable agriculture movements
 one of the major forces behind this movement has been the european union which first certified organic food in  and began reform of its common agricultural policy cap in  to phase out commoditylinked farm subsidies also known as decoupling
the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management selective breeding and controlledenvironment agriculture
recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food
demand for nonfood biofuel crops development of former farm lands rising transportation costs climate change growing consumer demand in china and india and population growth are threatening food security in many parts of the world
the international fund for agricultural development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security given the favorable experience of vietnam
soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally approximately  of the worlds agricultural land is seriously degraded
by  the agricultural output of china was the largest in the world followed by the european union india and the united states
economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the united states is roughly  times more productive than it was in 
following the threesector theory the number of people employed in agriculture and other primary activities such as fishing can be more than  in the least developed countries and less than  in the most highly developed countries
since the industrial revolution many countries have made the transition to developed economies and the proportion of people working in agriculture has steadily fallen
during the th century in europe for example between  and  of the population was engaged in agriculture by the th century this had dropped to between  and 
in the same countries today the figure is less than 
at the start of the st century some one billion people or over  of the available work force were employed in agriculture
it constitutes approximately  of the global employment of children and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry
the service sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 
agriculture specifically farming remains a hazardous industry and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of workrelated injuries lung disease noiseinduced hearing loss skin diseases as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure
on industrialized farms injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers
pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can be hazardous to worker health and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects
as an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself entire families can be at risk for injuries illness and death
ages  may be an especially vulnerable population in agriculture common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning machinery and motor accidents including with allterrain vehicles
the international labour organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors
it estimates that the annual workrelated death toll among agricultural employees is at least  twice the average rate of other jobs
in addition incidences of death injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported
the organization has developed the safety and health in agriculture convention  which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play
in the united states agriculture has been identified by the national institute for occupational safety and health as a priority industry sector in the national occupational research agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues
in the european union the european agency for safety and health at work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture livestock farming horticulture and forestry
the agricultural safety and health council of america ashca also holds a yearly summit to discuss safety
overall production varies by country as listed
the twenty largest countries by agricultural output in nominal terms at peak level as of  according to the imf and cia world factbook
cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints geography and climate of the farm government policy economic social and political pressures and the philosophy and culture of the farmer
shifting cultivation or slash and burn is a system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years
then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to a new plot returning after many more years 
this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure and some manual pest control
annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period
this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs
further industrialization led to the use of monocultures when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage
because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers
multiple cropping in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year and intercropping when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures
in subtropical and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year or requiring irrigation
in all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry
in temperate environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system
important categories of food crops include cereals legumes forage fruits and vegetables
natural fibers include cotton wool hemp silk and flax
specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world
production is listed in millions of metric tons based on fao estimates
animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat milk eggs or wool and for work and transport
working animals including horses mules oxen water buffalo camels llamas alpacas donkeys and dogs have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields harvest crops wrangle other animals and transport farm products to buyers
livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source as grasslandbased mixed and landless
as of update  of earths ice and waterfree area was used for producing livestock with the sector employing approximately  billion people
between the s and the s there was a significant increase in livestock production both by numbers and by carcass weight especially among beef pigs and chickens the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 
nonmeat animals such as milk cows and eggproducing chickens also showed significant production increases
global cattle sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 
aquaculture or fish farming the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production growing at an average of  a year between  and 
during the second half of the th century producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity
this trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds
grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and pastures for feeding ruminant animals
outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source
this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing   million pastoralists
mixed production systems use grassland fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric one stomach mainly chickens and pigs livestock
manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops
landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the delinking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic cooperation and development member countries
synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution
industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork
scientists estimate that  of the growth in livestock production between  and  will be in confined animal feeding operations sometimes called factory farming
much of this growth is happening in developing countries in asia with much smaller amounts of growth in africa
some of the practices used in commercial livestock production including the usage of growth hormones are controversial
tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or harrow to prepare for planting for nutrient incorporation or for pest control
tillage varies in intensity from conventional to notill
it may improve productivity by warming the soil incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds but also renders soil more prone to erosion triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms
pest control includes the management of weeds insects mites and diseases
chemical pesticides biological biocontrol mechanical tillage and cultural practices are used
cultural practices include crop rotation culling cover crops intercropping composting avoidance and resistance
integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss and recommends pesticides as a last resort
nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production and the method of use of manure produced by livestock
nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers manure green manure compost and minerals
crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period
manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing such as in managed intensive rotational grazing or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures
water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world
some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall
in other areas such as the great plains in the us and canada farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year
agriculture represents  of freshwater use worldwide
according to a report by the international food policy research institute agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by  the international food policy research institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as  and food prices could be reduced by almost half
payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment
measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city to improve the supply of fresh water
crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization
altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic makeup of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds droughttolerance or resistance to pests
significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel
his work on dominant and recessive alleles although initially largely ignored for almost  years gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques
crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits selfpollination and crosspollination and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism
domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants
careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants
plant selection and breeding in the s and s improved pasture grasses and clover in new zealand
extensive xray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts ie
primitive genetic engineering during the s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn maize and barley
the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating highyielding varieties
for example average yields of corn maize in the us have increased from around  tons per hectare tha  bushels per acre in  to about  tha  bushels per acre in 
similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than  tha in  to more than  tha in 
south american average wheat yields are around  tha african under  tha and egypt and arabia up to  to  tha with irrigation
in contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over  tha
variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control growth control to avoid lodging
genetically modified organisms gmo are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology
genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops
increased durability nutritional content insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering
for some gmo crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns
numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production import or use of gmo foods and crops
currently a global treaty the biosafety protocol regulates the trade of gmos
there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled the us does not
herbicideresistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides including glyphosate
these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop
herbicidetolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide
with the increasing use of herbicidetolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosatebased herbicide sprays
in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides
some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications
other gmo crops used by growers include insectresistant crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt which produces a toxin specific to insects
these crops resist damage by insects
some believe that similar or better pestresistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or crosspollination with wild species
in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least  diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes
agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation such as biodiversity loss desertification soil degradation and global warming which cause decrease in crop yield
agriculture is one of the most important drivers of environmental pressures particularly habitat change climate change water use and toxic emissions
agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment including insecticides especially those used on cotton
page needed the  unep green economy report stated that agricultural operations produced some  per cent of anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions
this includes gases from the use of inorganic fertilizers agrochemical pesticides and herbicides as well as fossil fuelenergy inputs
agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature especially herbicides and insecticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage and loss of natural environment
a assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for  of  million or  per hectare
a  analysis of these costs in the us concluded that cropland imposes approximately  to  billion  to  per hectare while livestock production imposes  million
both studies which focused solely on the fiscal impacts concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs
neither included subsidies in their analysis but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society
agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs
yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens predators and competitors such as weeds
costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units such as making fields larger this means removing hedges ditches and other areas of habitat
pesticides kill insects plants and fungi
these and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land
effective yields fall with onfarm losses which may be caused by poor production practices during harvesting handling and storage
a senior un official henning steinfeld said that livestock are one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems
livestock production occupies  of all land used for agriculture or  of the land surface of the planet
it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases responsible for  of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co equivalents
by comparison all transportation emits  of the co
it produces  of humanrelated nitrous oxide which has  times the global warming potential of co and  of all humaninduced methane which is  times as warming as co
it also generates  of the ammonia emission
livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation in the amazon basin  of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops
through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity
furthermore the unep states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by  per cent by  under current practices and consumption patterns
land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the earths ecosystems and is the driving force causing biodiversity loss
estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from  to 
land degradation the longterm decline in ecosystem function and productivity is estimated to be occurring on  of land worldwide with cropland overrepresented
land management is the driving factor behind degradation  billion people rely upon the degrading land
degradation can be through deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion acidification or salinization
eutrophication excessive nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia leads to fish kills loss of biodiversity and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses
excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient mainly nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and leaching from agricultural land
these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater with harmful effects on human populations
fertilisers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light favouring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients
agriculture accounts for  percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources
agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate
it is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern china the upper ganges and the western us are being depleted and new research extends these problems to aquifers in iran mexico and saudi arabia
increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the worlds growing population with reduced water resources
agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems including the destruction of natural wetlands the spread of waterborne diseases and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging when irrigation is performed incorrectly
pesticide use has increased since  to  million short tons annually worldwide yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant
the world health organization estimated in  that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually causing  deaths
pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide
an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website growing more per acre leaves more land for nature
however critics argue that a tradeoff between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation
the push pull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping using plant aromas to repel pests from crops push and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed pull
climate change and agriculture are interrelated on a global scale
global warming affects agriculture through changes in average temperatures rainfall and weather extremes like storms and heat waves changes in pests and diseases changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and groundlevel ozone concentrations changes in the nutritional quality of some foods and changes in sea level
global warming is already affecting agriculture with effects unevenly distributed across the world
future climate change will probably negatively affect crop production in low latitude countries while effects in northern latitudes may be positive or negative
global warming will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups such as the poor
animal husbandry is also responsible for greenhouse gas production of co and a percentage of the worlds methane and future land infertility and the displacement of wildlife
agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and by the conversion of nonagricultural land such as forest for agricultural use
agriculture forestry and landuse change contributed around  to  to global annual emissions in 
a range of policies can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector
current farming methods have resulted in overstretched water resources high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility
there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices therefore how critical water land and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered
a solution would be to give value to ecosystems recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests
inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights
technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable
technology permits innovations like conservation tillage a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion reduces water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration
other potential practices include conservation agriculture agroforestry improved grazing avoided grassland conversion and biochar
current monocrop farming practices in the united states preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices such as  crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy
the international food policy research institute states that agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by  it found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as  and food prices could be reduced by almost half
the food demand of earths projected population with current climate change predictions could be satisfied by improvement of agricultural methods expansion of agricultural areas and a sustainabilityoriented consumer mindset
since the s agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due largely to the increased use of energyintensive mechanization fertilizers and pesticides
the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources
between the s and the s the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe with world grain production increasing significantly between  and  for wheat and  to  for rice depending on geographic area as world population doubled
heavy reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output
industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm
direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery
indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers pesticides and farm machinery
in particular the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural energy usage
together direct and indirect consumption by us farms accounts for about  of the nations energy use
direct and indirect energy consumption by us farms peaked in  and has since gradually declined
food systems encompass not just agriculture but offfarm processing packaging transporting marketing consumption and disposal of food and foodrelated items
agriculture accounts for less than onefifth of food system energy use in the us
agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the production distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services
combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late s and grew significantly through the th century
although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the postamerican civil war southern united states to the european feudal system of manorialism
in the united states and elsewhere food costs attributed to food processing distribution and agricultural marketing sometimes referred to as the value chain have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined
this is related to the greater efficiency of farming combined with the increased level of value addition eg
more highly processed products provided by the supply chain
market concentration has increased in the sector as well and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers farmers and consumers and may have negative implications for rural communities
national government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products in the form of taxation subsidies tariffs and other measures
since at least the s a combination of trade restrictions exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world
in the s nonsubsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products
between the mids and the early s several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs subsidies and other trade restrictions
however as of update there was still a significant amount of policydriven distortion in global agricultural product prices
the three agricultural products with the most trade distortion were sugar milk and rice mainly due to taxation
among the oilseeds sesame had the most taxation but overall feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products
since the s policydriven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy
despite this progress certain crops such as cotton still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices causing hardship in developing countries with nonsubsidized farmers
unprocessed commodities such as corn soybeans and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality affecting the price the producer receives
commodities are generally reported by production quantities such as volume number or weight
agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture
it covers topics such as agronomy plant breeding and genetics plant pathology crop modelling soil science entomology production techniques and improvement study of pests and their management and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation waste management and bioremediation
the scientific study of agriculture began in the th century when johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum hydrated calcium sulphate as a fertilizer
research became more systematic when in  john lawes and henry gilbert began a set of longterm agronomy field experiments at rothamsted research station in england some of them such as the park grass experiment are still running
in america the hatch act of  provided funding for what it was the first to call agricultural science driven by farmers interest in fertilizers
in agricultural entomology the usda began to research biological control in  it instituted its first large program in  searching europe and japan for natural enemies of the gypsy moth and browntail moth establishing parasitoids such as solitary wasps and predators of both pests in the usa
agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products
governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets
some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment including policies related to climate change food safety and natural disasters economic stability including policies related to taxes natural resources and environmental sustainability especially water policy research and development and market access for domestic commodities including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries
agricultural policy can also touch on food quality ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality food security ensuring that the food supply meets the populations needs and conservation
policy programs can range from financial programs such as subsidies to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs
there are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy including consumers agribusiness trade lobbies and other groups
agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions
political action groups including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions also provide influence as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements
samuel jutzi director of faos animal production and health division states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment
for example proposals in  for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health and environmental regulations such as the number of animals an area of land can support without longterm damage were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure
the environmental impact of agriculture is the effect that different farming practices have on the ecosystems around them and how those effects can be traced back to those practices
the environmental impact of agriculture varies widely based on practices employed by farmers and by the scale of practice
farming communities that try to reduce environmental impacts through modifying their practices will adopt sustainable agriculture practices
though some pastoralism is environmentally positive modern animal agriculture practices tend to be more environmentally destructive than agricultural practices focused on fruits vegetables and other biomass
when evaluating environmental impact experts use two types of indicators meansbased which is based on the farmers production methods and effectbased which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment
an example of a meansbased indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is effected by the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil
an indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effectbased
the meansbased evaluation looks at farmers practices of agriculture and the effectbased evaluation considers the actual effects of the agricultural system
for example the meansbased analysis might look at pesticides and fertilization methods that farmers are using and effectbased analysis would consider how much co is being emitted or what the nitrogen content of the soil is
the environmental impact of agriculture involves impacts on a variety of different factors the soil to water the air animal and soil variety people plants and the food itself
agriculture contributes to a number larger of environmental issues that cause environmental degradation including climate change deforestation biodiversity loss dead zones genetic engineering irrigation problems pollutants soil degradation and waste
because of agricultures importance to global social and environmental systems the international community has committed to increasing sustainability of food production as part of sustainable development goal  end hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
the united nations environment programmes  making peace with nature report highlighted agriculture as both a driver and an industry under threat from environmental degradation
the environmental impact of meat production varies because of the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world
all agricultural practices have been found to have a variety of effects on the environment
some of the environmental effects that have been associated with meat production are pollution through fossil fuel usage animal methane effluent waste and water and land consumption
meat is obtained through a variety of methods including organic farming free range farming intensive livestock production subsistence agriculture hunting and fishing
meat is considered one of the prime factors contributing to the current sixth mass extinction
the  ipbes global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services found that industrial agriculture and overfishing are the primary drivers of the extinction crisis with the meat and dairy industries having a substantial impact
the  report livestocks long shadow released by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations states that the livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as a whole
globally it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases ghg and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity and in developed and emerging countries it is perhaps the leading source of water pollution
in this and much other fao usage but not always elsewhere poultry are included as livestock
a study published in the journal carbon balance and management found animal agricultures global methane emissions are  higher than previous estimates based on data from the intergovernmental panel on climate change
some fraction of these effects is assignable to nonmeat components of the livestock sector such as the wool egg and dairy industries and to the livestock used for tillage
livestock have been estimated to provide power for tillage of as much as half of the worlds cropland
a july  study in science asserts that meat consumption will increase as the result of human population growth and rising individual incomes which will increase carbon emissions and further reduce biodiversity
the environmental impacts of irrigation relate to the changes in quantity and quality of soil and water as a result of irrigation and the effects on natural and social conditions in river basins and downstream of an irrigation scheme
the impacts stem from the altered hydrological conditions caused by the installation and operation of the irrigation scheme
the impact of pesticides consists of the effects of pesticides on nontarget species
pesticides are chemical preparations used to kill fungal or animal pests
over  of sprayed insecticides and  of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species because they are sprayed or spread across entire agricultural fields
runoff can carry pesticides into aquatic environments while wind can carry them to other fields grazing areas human settlements and undeveloped areas potentially affecting other species
other problems emerge from poor production transport and storage practices
over time repeated application increases pest resistance while its effects on other species can facilitate the pests resurgence
climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes both of which take place on a worldwide scale
global warming is projected to have significant impacts on conditions affecting agriculture including temperature precipitation and glacial runoff
these conditions determine the carrying capacity of the biosphere to produce enough food for the human population and domesticated animals
rising carbon dioxide levels would also have effects both detrimental and beneficial on crop yields
assessment of the effects of global climate changes on agriculture might help to properly anticipate and adapt farming to maximize agricultural production
although the net impact of climate change on agricultural production is uncertain it is likely that it will shift the suitable growing zones for individual crops
adjustment to this geographical shift will involve considerable economic costs and social impacts
at the same time agriculture has been shown to produce significant effects on climate change primarily through the production and release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide
in addition agriculture that practices tillage fertilization and pesticide application also releases ammonia nitrate phosphorus and many other pesticides that affect air water and soil quality as well as biodiversity
agriculture also alters the earths land cover which can change its ability to absorb or reflect heat and light thus contributing to radiative forcing
land use change such as deforestation and desertification together with use of fossil fuels are the major anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide agriculture itself is the major contributor to increasing methane and nitrous oxide concentrations in earths atmosphere
most of the methane emissions result from the use of livestock in particular ruminants such as cattle and pigs
other livestock as poultry fish has a far lower impact
some solutions are being developed to counter the emissions of ruminants
strategies include using biogas from manure genetic selection immunization rumen defaunation outcompetition of methanogenic archaea with acetogens introduction of methanotrophic bacteria into the rumen diet modification and grazing management among others
certain diet changes such as with asparagopsis taxiformis allow for a reduction of up to  in ruminant greenhouse gas emissions
due to these negative impacts but also for reasons of farming efficiency see food vs feed one projection mentions a large decline of livestock at least some animals ie
cattle in certain countries by 
deforestation is clearing the earths forests on a large scale worldwide and resulting in many land damages
one of the causes of deforestation is to clear land for pasture or crops
according to british environmentalist norman myers  of deforestation is due to cattle ranching  due to overheavy logging  due to the growing sector of palm oil plantations and  due to slashandburn farming
deforestation causes the loss of habitat for millions of species and is also a driver of climate change
trees act as a carbon sink that is they absorb carbon dioxide an unwanted greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere
removing trees releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and leaves behind fewer trees to absorb the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the air
in this way deforestation exacerbates climate change
when trees are removed from forests the soils tend to dry out because there is no longer shade and there are not enough trees to assist in the water cycle by returning water vapor back to the environment
with no trees landscapes that were once forests can potentially become barren deserts
the removal of trees also causes extreme fluctuations in temperature
in the united nations food and agriculture organization fao found that the role of population dynamics in a local setting may vary from decisive to negligible and that deforestation can result from a combination of population pressure and stagnating economic social and technological conditions
agricultural pollution refers to biotic and abiotic byproducts of farming practices that result in contamination or degradation of the environment and surrounding ecosystems andor cause injury to humans and their economic interests
the pollution may come from a variety of sources ranging from point source water pollution from a single discharge point to more diffuse landscapelevel causes also known as nonpoint source pollution and air pollution
once in the environment these pollutants can have both direct effects in surrounding ecosystems ie
killing local wildlife or contaminating drinking water and downstream effects such as dead zones caused by agricultural runoff is concentrated in large water bodies
management practices or ignorance of them play a crucial role in the amount and impact of these pollutants
management techniques range from animal management and housing to the spread of pesticides and fertilizers in global agricultural practicesbad managament practices include poorly managed animal feeding operations overgrazing plowing fertilizer and improper excessive or badly timed use of pesticides
pollutants from agriculture greatly affect water quality and can be found in lakes rivers wetlands estuaries and groundwater
pollutants from farming include sediments nutrients pathogens pesticides metals and salts
animal agriculture has an outsized impact on pollutants that enter the environment
bacteria and pathogens in manure can make their way into streams and groundwater if grazing storing manure in lagoons and applying manure to fields is not properly managed
air pollution caused by agriculture through land use changes and animal agriculture practices have an outsized impact on climate change and addressing these concerns were a central part of the ipcc special report on climate change and land
soil degradation is the decline in soil quality that can be a result of many factors especially from agriculture
soils hold the majority of the worlds biodiversity and healthy soils are essential for food production and adequate water supply
common attributes of soil degradation can be salting waterlogging compaction pesticide contamination a decline in soil structure quality loss of fertility changes in soil acidity alkalinity salinity and erosion
soil erosion is the wearing away of topsoil by water wind or farming activities
topsoil is very fertile which makes it valuable to farmers growing crops
soil degradation also has a huge impact on biological degradation which affects the microbial community of the soil and can alter nutrient cycling pest and disease control and chemical transformation properties of the soil
plasticulture is the use of plastic mulch in agriculture
farmers use plastic sheets as mulch to cover  of the soil and allow them to use drip irrigation systems to have better control over soil nutrients and moisture
rain is not required in this system and farms that use plasticulture are built to encourage the fastest runoff of rain
the use of pesticides with plasticulture allows pesticides to be transported easier in the surface runoff towards wetlands or tidal creeks
the runoff from pesticides and chemicals in the plastic can cause serious deformations and death in shellfish as the runoff carries the chemicals towards the oceans
in addition to the increased runoff that results from plasticulture there is also the problem of the increased amount of waste from the plastic mulch itself
the use of plastic mulch for vegetables strawberries and other row and orchard crops exceeds  million pounds annually in the united states
most plastic ends up in the landfill although there are other disposal options such as disking mulches into the soil onsite burying onsite storage reuse recycling and incineration
the incineration and recycling options are complicated by the variety of the types of plastics that are used and by the geographic dispersal of the plastics
plastics also contain stabilizers and dyes as well as heavy metals which limits the number of products that can be recycled
research is continually being conducted on creating biodegradable or photodegradable mulches
while there has been a minor success with this there is also the problem of how long the plastic takes to degrade as many biodegradable products take a long time to break down
the environmental impact of agriculture can vary depending on the region as well as the type of agriculture production method that is being used
listed below are some specific environmental issues in various different regions around the world
sustainable agriculture is the idea that agriculture should occur in a way such that we can continue to produce what is necessary without infringing on the ability for future generations to do the same
the exponential population increase in recent decades has increased the practice of agricultural land conversion to meet the demand for food which in turn has increased the effects on the environment
the global population is still increasing and will eventually stabilize as some critics doubt that food production due to lower yields from global warming can support the global population
agriculture can have negative effects on biodiversity as well
organic farming is a multifaceted sustainable agriculture set of practices that can have a lower impact on the environment at a small scale
however in most cases organic farming results in lower yields in terms of production per unit area
therefore widespread adoption of organic agriculture will require additional land to be cleared and water resources extracted to meet the same level of production
a european metaanalysis found that organic farms tended to have higher soil organic matter content and lower nutrient losses nitrogen leaching nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia emissions per unit of field area but higher ammonia emissions nitrogen leaching and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit
it is believed by many that conventional farming systems cause less rich biodiversity than organic systems
organic farming has shown to have on average  higher species richness than conventional farming
organic systems on average also have  more organisms
this data has some issues because there were several results that showed a negative effect on these things when in an organic farming system
the opposition to organic agriculture believes that these negatives are an issue with the organic farming system
what began as a small scale environmentally conscious practice has now become just as industrialized as conventional agriculture
this industrialization can lead to the issues shown above such as climate change and deforestation
regenerative agriculture is a conservation and rehabilitation approach to food and farming systems
it focuses on topsoil regeneration increasing biodiversity improving the water cycle enhancing ecosystem services supporting biosequestration increasing resilience to climate change and strengthening the health and vitality of farm soil
practices include recycling as much farm waste as possible and adding composted material from sources outside the farm
regenerative agriculture on small farms and gardens is often based on philosophies like permaculture agroecology agroforestry restoration ecology keyline design and holistic management
large farms tend to be less philosophy driven and often use notill andor reduced till practices
as soil health improves input requirements may decrease and crop yields may increase as soils are more resilient against extreme weather and harbour fewer pests and pathogens
conservation tillage is an alternative tillage method for farming which is more sustainable for the soil and surrounding ecosystem
this is done by allowing the residue of the previous harvests crops to remain in the soil before tilling for the next crop
conservation tillage has shown to improve many things such as soil moisture retention and reduce erosion
some disadvantages are the fact that more expensive equipment is needed for this process more pesticides will need to be used and the positive effects take a long time to be visible
the barriers of instantiating a conservation tillage policy are that farmers are reluctant to change their methods and would protest a more expensive and timeconsuming method of tillage than the conventional one they are used to
biological control or biocontrol is a method of controlling pests such as insects mites weeds and plant diseases using other organisms
it relies on predation parasitism herbivory or other natural mechanisms but typically also involves an active human management role
it can be an important component of integrated pest management ipm programs
there are three basic strategies for biological pest control classical importation where a natural enemy of a pest is introduced in the hope of achieving control inductive augmentation in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control and inoculative conservation in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment
natural enemies of insect pests also known as biological control agents include predators parasitoids pathogens and competitors
biological control agents of plant diseases are most often referred to as antagonists
biological control agents of weeds include seed predators herbivores and plant pathogens
a farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops it is the basic facility in food production
the name is used for specialised units such as arable farms vegetable farms fruit farms dairy pig and poultry farms and land used for the production of natural fibres biofuel and other commodities
it includes ranches feedlots orchards plantations and estates smallholdings and hobby farms and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land
in modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms both of which can operate on land or sea
farming originated independently in different parts of the world as hunter gatherer societies transitioned to food production rather than food capture
it may have started about  years ago with the domestication of livestock in the fertile crescent in western asia soon to be followed by the cultivation of crops
modern units tend to specialise in the crops or livestock best suited to the region with their finished products being sold for the retail market or for further processing with farm products being traded around the world
modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized
in the united states livestock may be raised on rangeland and finished in feedlots and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed
in europe traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units
in australia some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions
in less developed countries small farms are the norm and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market
the word in the sense of an agricultural landholding derives from the verb to farm a revenue source whether taxes customs rents of a group of manors or simply to hold an individual manor by the feudal land tenure of fee farm
the word is from the medieval latin noun firma also the source of the french word ferme meaning a fixed agreement contract from the classical latin adjective firmus meaning strong stout firm
as in the medieval age virtually all manors were engaged in the business of agriculture which was their principal revenue source so to hold a manor by the tenure of fee farm became synonymous with the practice of agriculture itself
farming has been innovated at multiple different points and places in human history
the transition from huntergatherer to settled agricultural societies is called the neolithic revolution and first began around  years ago near the beginning of the geological epoch of the holocene around  years ago
it was the worlds first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture
subsequent stepchanges in human farming practices were provoked by the british agricultural revolution in the th century and the green revolution of the second half of the th century
farming spread from the middle east to europe and by  bc people that lived in the central part of europe were using oxen to pull plows and wagons
a farm may be owned and operated by a single individual family community corporation or a company may produce one or many types of produce and can be a holding of any size from a fraction of a hectare to several thousand hectares
a farm may operate under a monoculture system or with a variety of cereal or arable crops which may be separate from or combined with raising livestock
specialist farms are often denoted as such thus a dairy farm fish farm poultry farm or mink farm
some farms may not use the word at all hence vineyard grapes orchard nuts and other fruit market garden or truck farm vegetables and flowers
some farms may be denoted by their topographical location such as a hill farm while large estates growing cash crops such as cotton or coffee may be called plantations
many other terms are used to describe farms to denote their methods of production as in collective corporate intensive organic or vertical
other farms may primarily exist for research or education such as an ant farm and since farming is synonymous with mass production the word farm may be used to describe wind power generation or puppy farm
dairy farming is a class of agriculture where female cattle goats or other mammals are raised for their milk which may be either processed onsite or transported to a dairy for processing and eventual retail sale there are many breeds of cattle that can be milked some of the best producing ones include holstein norwegian red kostroma brown swiss and more
in most western countries a centralized dairy facility processes milk and dairy products such as cream butter and cheese
in the united states these dairies are usually local companies while in the southern hemisphere facilities may be run by very large nationwide or transnational corporations such as fonterra
dairy farms generally sell male calves for veal meat as dairy breeds are not normally satisfactory for commercial beef production
many dairy farms also grow their own feed typically including corn alfalfa and hay
this is fed directly to the cows or stored as silage for use during the winter season
additional dietary supplements are added to the feed to improve milk production
poultry farms are devoted to raising chickens egg layers or broilers turkeys ducks and other fowl generally for meat or eggs
a pig farm is one that specializes in raising pigs or hogs for bacon ham and other pork products
they may be free range intensive or both
farm control and ownership has traditionally been a key indicator of status and power especially in medieval european agrarian societies
the distribution of farm ownership has historically been closely linked to form of government
medieval feudalism was essentially a system that centralized control of farmland control of farm labor and political power while the early american democracy in which land ownership was a prerequisite for voting rights was built on relatively easy paths to individual farm ownership
however the gradual modernization and mechanization of farming which greatly increases both the efficiency and capital requirements of farming has led to increasingly large farms
this has usually been accompanied by the decoupling of political power from farm ownership
citation needed
in some societies especially socialist and communist collective farming is the norm with either government ownership of the land or common ownership by a local group
especially in societies without widespread industrialized farming tenant farming and sharecropping are common farmers either pay landowners for the right to use farmland or give up a portion of the crops
the land and buildings of a farm are called the farmstead
citation needed
enterprises where livestock are raised on rangeland are called ranches
where livestock are raised in confinement on feed produced elsewhere the term feedlot is usually used

the share of us farms operated by women has risen steadily over recent decades from  percent in  to  percent by 
in the united states there are over three million migrant and seasonal farmworkers  are foreignborn  are male they have an average age of  and average education of  years
farmworkers make an average hourly rate of   per hour compared to an average of over  per hour for nonfarm labor

according to the world bank most empirical evidence indicates that land productivity on large farms in pakistan is lower than that of small farms holding other factors constant
small farmers have higher net returns per hectare than large farms according to farm
household income data
nepal is an agricultural country and about  of the total population are engaged in farming
rice is mainly produced in nepal along with fruits like apples
dairy farming and poultry farming are also growing in nepal
farming is a significant economic sector in australia
a farm is an area of land used for primary production which will include buildings
according to the un green agriculture directs a greater share of total farming input expenditures towards the purchase of locally sourced inputeg
labour and organic fertilisers and a local multiplier effect is expected to kick in
overall green farming practices tend to require more labour inputs than conventional farming eg
from comparable levels to as much as  per cent more fao  and european commission  creating jobs in rural areas and a higher return on labour inputs
where most of the income is from some other employment and the farm is really an expanded residence the term hobby farm is common
this will allow sufficient size for recreational use but be very unlikely to produce sufficient income to be selfsustaining
hobby farms are commonly around  hectares  acres but may be much larger depending upon land prices which vary regionally
often very small farms used for intensive primary production are referred to by the specialization they are being used for such as a dairy rather than a dairy farm a piggery a market garden etc
this also applies to feedlots which are specifically developed to a single purpose and are often not able to be used for more general purpose mixed farming practices
in remote areas farms can become quite large
as with estates in england there is no defined size or method of operation at which a large farm becomes a station
in the uk farm as an agricultural unit always denotes the area of pasture and other fields together with its farmhouse farmyard and outbuildings
large farms or groups of farms under the same ownership may be called an estate
conversely a small farm surrounding the owners dwelling is called a smallholding and is generally focused on selfsufficiency with only the surplus being sold
a farm in africa includes various structures
depending on climaterelated areas primarily farming is the raising and breeding of grazing livestock such as cattle sheep ostriches horses or goats
predominantly domestic animals are raised for their meat milk skin leather or fiber wool
you might even come across silk farms
furthermore there are plenty of hunting farms guest farms and game farms
arable or irrigated land is often used for raising crops such as feed grains and hay for animal feeding
on some farms astro farm stargazing became very popular because of the excellent optical quality in the desert
the high energy stereoscopic system hess
which investigates cosmic gamma rays is situated on farm göllschau in namibia
farm equipment has evolved over the centuries from simple hand tools such as the hoe through ox or horsedrawn equipment such as the plough and harrow to the modern highly technical machinery such as the tractor baler and combine harvester replacing what was a highly labourintensive occupation before the industrial revolution
today much of the farm equipment used on both small and large farms is automated eg
using satellite guided farming
as new types of hightech farm equipment have become inaccessible to farmers that historically fixed their own equipment wired reports there is a growing backlash due mostly to companies using intellectual property law to prevent farmers from having the legal right to fix their equipment or gain access to the information to allow them to do it
this has encouraged groups such as open source ecology and farm hack to begin to make open source hardware for agricultural machinery
in addition on a smaller scale farmbot  and the reprap open source d printer community has begun to make opensource farm tools available of increasing levels of sophistication
meaning of farmer types of farmer five richest farmers
a farmer also called an agriculturer is a person engaged in agriculture raising living organisms for food or raw materials
the term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops orchards vineyards poultry or other livestock
a farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others but in advanced economies a farmer is usually a farm owner while employees of the farm are known as farm workers or farmhands
however in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of a plant crop etc
by labor and attention land or crops or raises animals as livestock or fish
farming dates back as far as the neolithic being one of the defining characteristics of that era
by the bronze age the sumerians had an agriculture specialized labor force by   bce and heavily depended on irrigation to grow crops
they relied on threeperson teams when harvesting in the spring
the ancient egypt farmers farmed and relied and irrigated their water from the nile
animal husbandry the practice of rearing animals specifically for farming purposes has existed for thousands of years
dogs were domesticated in east asia about  years ago
goats and sheep were domesticated around  bce in asia
swine or pigs were domesticated by  bce in the middle east and china
the earliest evidence of horse domestication dates to around  bce
in the us of the s one farmer could only produce enough food to feed three other consumers
a modernday farmer produces enough food to feed well over a hundred people
however some authors consider this estimate to be flawed as it does not take into account that farming requires energy and many other resources which have to be provided by additional workers so that the ratio of people fed to farmers is actually smaller than  to 
more distinct terms are commonly used to denote farmers who raise specific domesticated animals
for example those who raise grazing livestock such as cattle sheep goats and horses are known as ranchers us graziers australia uk or simply stockmen
sheep goat and cattle farmers might also be referred to respectively as shepherds goatherds and cowherds
the term dairy farmer is applied to those engaged primarily in milk production whether from cattle goats sheep or other milk producing animals
a poultry farmer is one who concentrates on raising chickens turkeys ducks or geese for either meat egg or feather production or commonly all three
a person who raises a variety of vegetables for market may be called a truck farmer or market gardener
dirt farmer is an american colloquial term for a practical farmer or one who farms his own land
in developed nations a farmer as a profession is usually defined as someone with an ownership interest in crops or livestock and who provides land or management in their production
those who provide only labor are most often called farmhands
alternatively growers who manage farmland for an absentee landowner sharing the harvest or its profits are known as sharecroppers or sharefarmers
in the context of agribusiness a farmer is defined broadly and thus many individuals not necessarily engaged in fulltime farming can nonetheless legally qualify under agricultural policy for various subsidies incentives and tax deductions
in the context of developing nations or other preindustrial cultures most farmers practice a meager subsistence agriculture a simple organicfarming system employing crop rotation seed saving slash and burn or other techniques to maximize efficiency while meeting the needs of the household or community
one subsisting in this way may become labelled as a peasant often associated disparagingly with a peasant mentality
in developed nations however a person using such techniques on small patches of land might be called a gardener and be considered a hobbyist
alternatively one might be driven into such practices by poverty or ironically against the background of largescale agribusiness might become an organic farmer growing for discerningfaddish consumers in the local food market
farmers are often members of local regional or national farmers unions or agricultural producers organizations and can exert significant political influence
the grange movement in the united states was effective in advancing farmers agendas especially against railroad and agribusiness interests early in the th century
the fnsea is very politically active in france especially pertaining to genetically modified food
agricultural producers both small and large are represented globally by the international federation of agricultural producers ifap representing over  million farmers through  national farmers unions in  countries
farmed products might be sold either to a market in a farmers market or directly from a farm
in a subsistence economy farm products might to some extent be either consumed by the farmers family or pooled by the community
there are several occupational hazards for those in agriculture farming is a particularly dangerous industry
farmers can encounter and be stung or bitten by dangerous insects and other arthropods including scorpions fire ants bees wasps and hornets
farmers also work around heavy machinery which can kill or injure them
farmers can also establish muscle and joints pains from repeated work
the word farmer originally meant a person collecting taxes from tenants working a field owned by a landlord
the word changed to refer to the person farming the field
previous names for a farmer were churl and husbandman

any plant that is welladapted to environments in which the land is cultivated for growing some other plant
see also crop weed
wildcrafting
the human practice of foraging for uncultivated plants or fungi from their natural or wild habitats primarily for food or medicine
wildculture
windbreak
also called a shelterbelt
one or more rows of closely spaced trees or shrubs planted in such a way as to provide shelter to an adjacent agricultural field from the wind thereby protecting the area from excessive cold and soil erosion
windbreaks commonly take the form of hedgerows planted around the edges of fields on farms but may also be made from artificial materials such as large canvas panels
aside from decreasing wind speeds they may also be designed to separate farms from roads or motorways or to collect snowdrifts that will provide water to otherwise dry farmland when the snow melts in the spring
windrow
a row of cut or mown hay or small grain crop that is allowed to dry in a field before being baled combined or rolled
windrows may be built deliberately after cutting or they may form automatically as a result of the method by which the crop is mown
winnowing
the process or technique performed either manually or mechanically by which grain is separated from chaff
traditional manual winnowing involves throwing the unseparated mixture into the air so that the wind blows away the lighter chaff while the heavier grains fall back to the ground for recovery
in modern agriculture winnowing is often entirely mechanized
xeriscaping
the practice of gardening or landscaping so as to reduce or eliminate the need for supplemental water from irrigation
xeriscaping requires the selection of plants whose natural requirements are appropriate to the local climate with a particular emphasis on water conservation and focuses on designing and maintaining the land in such a way as to avoid losing water to evaporation and runoff

the history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively
agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included a diverse range of taxa
at least eleven separate regions of the old and new world were involved as independent centers of origin
wild grains were collected and eaten from at least  years ago
 however domestication did not occur until much later
starting from around  bc the eight neolithic founder crops emmer wheat einkorn wheat hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chickpeas and flax were cultivated in the levant
 rye may have been cultivated earlier but this remains controversial
 rice was domesticated in china by  bc with earliest known cultivation from  bc followed by mung soy and azuki beans
pigs were domesticated in mesopotamia around  bc followed by sheep between  bc and  bc
cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and india around  bc
sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around  bc
sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by  bc
in the andes of south america the potato was domesticated between  bc and  bc along with beans coca llamas alpacas and guinea pigs
bananas were cultivated and hybridized in the same period in papua new guinea
in mesoamerica wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by  bc
cotton was domesticated in peru by  bc
camels were domesticated late perhaps around  bc
in australia agriculture was invented at a currently unspecified period with the oldest eel traps of budj bim dating to  bc and the deployment of several crops ranging from yams to bananas
the bronze age from c  bc witnessed the intensification of agriculture in civilizations such as mesopotamian sumer ancient egypt the indus valley civilisation of the indian subcontinent ancient china and ancient greece
during the iron age and era of classical antiquity the expansion of ancient rome both the republic and then the empire throughout the ancient mediterranean and western europe built upon existing systems of agriculture while also establishing the manorial system that became a bedrock of medieval agriculture
in the middle ages both in the islamic world and in europe agriculture was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants including the introduction of sugar rice cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to europe by way of alandalus
after the voyages of christopher columbus in  the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize potatoes sweet potatoes and manioc to europe and old world crops such as wheat barley rice and turnips and livestock including horses cattle sheep and goats to the americas
irrigation crop rotation and fertilizers were introduced soon after the neolithic revolution and developed much further in the past  years starting with the british agricultural revolution
since  agriculture in the developed nations and to a lesser extent in the developing world has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization and assisted by synthetic fertilizers pesticides and selective breeding
the haberbosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale greatly increasing crop yields
modern agriculture has raised social political and environmental issues including overpopulation water pollution biofuels genetically modified organisms tariffs and farm subsidies
in response organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides
scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture
studies of the transition from huntergatherer to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism examples are the natufian culture in the levant and the early chinese neolithic in china
current models indicate that wild stands that had been harvested previously started to be planted but were not immediately domesticated
localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the levant
when major climate change took place after the last ice age c  bc much of the earth became subject to long dry seasons
these conditions favoured annual plants which die off in the long dry season leaving a dormant seed or tuber
an abundance of readily storable wild grains and pulses enabled huntergatherers in some areas to form the first settled villages at this time
early people began altering communities of flora and fauna for their own benefit through means such as firestick farming and forest gardening very early
wild grains have been collected and eaten from at least  years ago and possibly much longer
exact dates are hard to determine as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection
an example is the semitough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the younger dryas about  bc in the early holocene in the levant region of the fertile crescent
monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally
agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included a diverse range of taxa
at least  separate regions of the old and new world were involved as independent centers of origin
some of the earliest known domestications were of animals
domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in eurasia including europe east asia and southwest asia where wild boar were first domesticated about  years ago
sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between  bc and  bc
cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan around  bc
camels were domesticated late perhaps around  bc
it was not until after  bc that the eight socalled founder crops of agriculture appear first emmer and einkorn wheat then hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax
these eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on prepottery neolithic b ppnb sites in the levant although wheat was the first to be grown and harvested on a significant scale
at around the same time  bc parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated
domesticated rye occurs in small quantities at some neolithic sites in asia minor turkey such as the prepottery neolithic b c  c  bc can hasan iii near  but is otherwise absent until the bronze age of central europe c   bc
claims of much earlier cultivation of rye at the epipalaeolithic site of tell abu hureyra in the euphrates valley of northern syria remain controversial
critics point to inconsistencies in the radiocarbon dates and identifications based solely on grain rather than on chaff
by  bc farming was entrenched on the banks of the nile
about this time agriculture was developed independently in the far east probably in china with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop
maize was domesticated from the wild grass teosinte in west mexico by  bc
the potato  bc tomato pepper  bc squash  bc and several varieties of bean  bc onwards were domesticated in the new world
agriculture was independently developed on the island of new guinea
banana cultivation of musa acuminata including hybridization dates back to  bc and possibly to  bc in papua new guinea
bees were kept for honey in the middle east around  bc
archaeological evidence from various sites on the iberian peninsula suggest the domestication of plants and animals between  and  bc
céide fields in ireland consisting of extensive tracts of land enclosed by stone walls date to  bc and are the oldest known field systems in the world
the horse was domesticated in the pontic steppe around  bc
in siberia cannabis was in use in china in neolithic times and may have been domesticated there it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in ancient egypt by about  bc
in northern china millet was domesticated by early sinotibetan speakers at around  to  bc becoming the main crop of the yellow river basin by  bc
they were followed by mung soy and azuki beans
in southern china rice was domesticated in the yangtze river basin at around  to  bc along with the development of wetland agriculture by early austronesian and hmongmienspeakers
other food plants were also harvested including acorns water chestnuts and foxnuts
rice cultivation was later spread to island southeast asia by the austronesian expansion starting at around  to  bc
this migration event also saw the introduction of cultivated and domesticated food plants from taiwan island southeast asia and new guinea into the pacific islands as canoe plants
contact with sri lanka and southern india by austronesian sailors also led to an exchange of food plants which later became the origin of the valuable spice trade
in the st millennium ad austronesian sailors also settled madagascar and the comoros bringing southeast asian and south asian food plants with them to the east african coast including bananas and rice
rice was also spread southwards into mainland southeast asia by around  to  bc by the migrations of the early austroasiatic and kradaispeakers
in the sahel region of africa sorghum was domesticated by  bc in sudan and pearl millet by  bc in mali
kola nut and coffee were also domesticated in africa
in new guinea ancient papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around  bc domesticating sugarcane and taro
in the indus valley from the eighth millennium bc onwards at mehrgarh row and row barley were cultivated along with einkorn emmer and durum wheats and dates
in the earliest levels of merhgarh wild game such as gazelle swamp deer blackbuck chital wild ass wild goat wild sheep boar and nilgai were all hunted for food
these are successively replaced by domesticated sheep goats and humped zebu cattle by the fifth millennium bc indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture
maize and squash were domesticated in mesoamerica potato in south america and sunflower in the eastern woodlands of north america
sumerian farmers grew the cereals barley and wheat starting to live in villages from about  bc
given the low rainfall of the region agriculture relied on the tigris and euphrates rivers
irrigation canals leading from the rivers permitted the growth of cereals in large enough quantities to support cities
the first ploughs appear in pictographs from uruk around  bc seedploughs that funneled seed into the ploughed furrow appear on seals around  bc
vegetable crops included chickpeas lentils peas beans onions garlic lettuce leeks and mustard
they grew fruits including dates grapes apples melons and figs
alongside their farming sumerians also caught fish and hunted fowl and gazelle
the meat of sheep goats cows and poultry was eaten mainly by the elite
fish was preserved by drying salting and smoking
the civilization of ancient egypt was indebted to the nile river and its dependable seasonal flooding
the rivers predictability and the fertile soil allowed the egyptians to build an empire on the basis of great agricultural wealth
egyptians were among the first peoples to practice agriculture on a large scale starting in the predynastic period from the end of the paleolithic into the neolithic between around  bc and  bc
this was made possible with the development of basin irrigation
their staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus
jujube was domesticated in the indian subcontinent by  bc
barley and wheat cultivation along with the domestication of cattle primarily sheep and goats followed in mehrgarh culture by   bc
this period also saw the first domestication of the elephant
pastoral farming in india included threshing planting crops in rows either of two or of six and storing grain in granaries
cotton was cultivated by the th th millennium bc
by the th millennium bc agricultural communities became widespread in kashmir
irrigation was developed in the indus valley civilization by around  bc
the size and prosperity of the indus civilization grew as a result of this innovation leading to more thoroughly planned settlements which used drainage and sewers
archeological evidence of an animaldrawn plough dates back to  bc in the indus valley civilization
records from the warring states qin dynasty and han dynasty provide a picture of early chinese agriculture from the th century bc to nd century ad which included a nationwide granary system and widespread use of sericulture
an important early chinese book on agriculture is the qimin yaoshu of ad  written by jia sixie
jias writing style was straightforward and lucid relative to the elaborate and allusive writing typical of the time
jias book was also very long with over one hundred thousand written chinese characters and it quoted many other chinese books that were written previously but no longer survive
the contents of jias th century book include sections on land preparation seeding cultivation orchard management forestry and animal husbandry
the book also includes peripherally related content covering trade and culinary uses for crops
the work and the style in which it was written proved influential on later chinese agronomists such as wang zhen and his groundbreaking nong shu of 
for agricultural purposes the chinese had innovated the hydraulicpowered trip hammer by the st century bc
although it found other purposes its main function to pound decorticate and polish grain that otherwise would have been done manually
the chinese also began using the squarepallet chain pump by the st century ad powered by a waterwheel or oxen pulling an on a system of mechanical wheels
although the chain pump found use in public works of providing water for urban and palatial pipe systems it was used largely to lift water from a lower to higher elevation in filling irrigation canals and channels for farmland
by the end of the han dynasty in the late nd century heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards
these slowly spread west revolutionizing farming in northern europe by the th century
thomas glick however argues for a development of the chinese plough as late as the th century implying its spread east from similar designs known in italy by the th century
asian rice was domesticated   years ago in china with a single genetic origin from the wild rice oryza rufipogon in the pearl river valley region of china
rice cultivation then spread to south and southeast asia
the major cereal crops of the ancient mediterranean region were wheat emmer and barley while common vegetables included peas beans fava and olives dairy products came mostly from sheep and goats and meat which was consumed on rare occasion for most people usually consisted of pork beef and lamb
agriculture in ancient greece was hindered by the topography of mainland greece that only allowed for roughly  of the land to be cultivated properly necessitating the specialized exportation of oil and wine and importation of grains from thrace centered in what is now bulgaria and the greek colonies of southern russia
during the hellenistic period the ptolemaic empire controlled egypt cyprus phoenicia and cyrenaica major grainproducing regions that mainland greeks depended on for subsistence while the ptolemaic grain market also played a critical role in the rise of the roman republic
in the seleucid empire mesopotamia was a crucial area for the production of wheat while nomadic animal husbandry was also practiced in other parts
in the grecoroman world of classical antiquity roman agriculture was built on techniques originally pioneered by the sumerians transmitted to them by subsequent cultures with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export
the romans laid the groundwork for the manorial economic system involving serfdom which flourished in the middle ages
the farm sizes in rome can be divided into three categories
small farms were from   iugera one iugerum is equal to about  acre
mediumsized farms were from   iugera singular iugerum
large estates called latifundia were over  iugera
the romans had four systems of farm management direct work by owner and his family slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farms produce and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant
in mesoamerica wild teosinte was transformed through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize more than  years ago
it gradually spread across north america and was the major crop of native americans at the time of european exploration
other mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans while cocoa also domesticated in the region was a major crop
the turkey one of the most important meat birds was probably domesticated in mexico or the us
southwest
in mesoamerica the aztecs were active farmers and had an agriculturally focused economy
the land around lake texcoco was fertile but not large enough to produce the amount of food needed for the population of their expanding empire
the aztecs developed irrigation systems formed terraced hillsides fertilized their soil and developed chinampas or artificial islands also known as floating gardens
the mayas between  bc to  ad used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland on the yucatán peninsula
in the andes region of south america with civilizations including the inca the major crop was the potato domesticated approximately   years ago
coca still a major crop to this day was domesticated in the andes as were the peanut tomato tobacco and pineapple
cotton was domesticated in peru by  bc
animals were also domesticated including llamas alpacas and guinea pigs
guaitecas archipelago in patagonia made up the southern limit of prehispanic agriculture as noted by the mention of the cultivation of chiloé potatoes by a spanish expedition in 
the presence of maize in guaitecas archipelago is also mentioned by early spanish explorers albeit the spanish may have misidentified the plant
the indigenous people of the eastern us domesticated numerous crops
sunflowers tobacco varieties of squash and chenopodium as well as crops no longer grown including marsh elder and little barley were domesticated
wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested
the domesticated strawberry is a hybrid of a chilean and a north american species developed by breeding in europe and north america
two major crops pecans and concord grapes were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but do not appear to have been domesticated until the th century
the indigenous people in what is now california and the pacific northwest practiced various forms of forest gardening and firestick farming in the forests grasslands mixed woodlands and wetlands ensuring that desired food and medicine plants continued to be available
the natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a lowintensity fire ecology which prevented larger catastrophic fires and sustained a lowdensity agriculture in loose rotation a sort of wild permaculture
a system of companion planting called the three sisters was developed in north america
three crops that complemented each other were planted together winter squash maize corn and climbing beans typically tepary beans or common beans
the maize provides a structure for the beans to climb eliminating the need for poles
the beans provide the nitrogen to the soil that the other plants use and the squash spreads along the ground blocking the sunlight helping prevent the establishment of weeds
the squash leaves also act as a living mulch
indigenous australians were nomadic huntergatherers
due to the policy of terra nullius aboriginals were regarded as not having been capable of sustained agriculture
however the current consensus is that various agricultural methods were employed by the indigenous people
in two regions of central australia the central west coast and eastern central australia forms of agriculture were practiced
people living in permanent settlements of over  residents sowed or planted on a large scale and stored the harvested food
the nhanda and amangu of the central west coast grew yams dioscorea hastifolia while various groups in eastern central australia the corners region planted and harvested bush onions yaua cyperus bulbosus native millet cooly tindil panicum decompositum and a sporocarp ngardu marsilea drummondii
indigenous australians used systematic burning firestick farming to enhance natural productivity
in the s and s archaeological research in south west victoria established that the gunditjmara and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly  years
the archaeologist harry lourandos suggested in the s that there was evidence of intensification in progress across australia a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding  years
these concepts led the historian bill gammage to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape
torres islanders are now known to have planted bananas
from  bc to  ad world population continued to grow along with land use as evidenced by the rapid increase in methane emissions from cattle and the cultivation of rice
from the th century the medieval islamic world underwent a transformation in agricultural practice described by the historian andrew watson as the arab agricultural revolution
this transformation was driven by a number of factors including the diffusion of many crops and plants along muslim trade routes the spread of more advanced farming techniques and an agriculturaleconomic system which promoted increased yields and efficiency
the shift in agricultural practice changed the economy population distribution vegetation cover agricultural production population levels urban growth the distribution of the labour force cooking diet and clothing across the islamic world
muslim traders covered much of the old world and trade enabled the diffusion of many crops plants and farming techniques across the region as well as the adaptation of crops plants and techniques from beyond the islamic world
this diffusion introduced major crops to europe by way of alandalus along with the techniques for their cultivation and cuisine
sugar cane rice and cotton were among the major crops transferred along with citrus and other fruit trees nut trees vegetables such as aubergine spinach and chard and the use of imported spices such as cumin coriander nutmeg and cinnamon
intensive irrigation crop rotation and agricultural manuals were widely adopted
irrigation partly based on roman technology made use of noria water wheels water mills dams and reservoirs
the middle ages saw further improvements in agriculture
monasteries spread throughout europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry
the manorial system allowed large landowners to control their land and its laborers in the form of peasants or serfs
during the medieval period the arab world was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the european asia and african continents
besides transporting numerous crops they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to europe and developed the beginnings of the plantation system of sugarcane growing through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation
by ad  developments in iron smelting allowed for increased production in europe leading to developments in the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs hand tools and horse shoes
the carruca heavy plough improved on the earlier scratch plough with the adoption of the chinese mouldboard plough to turn over the heavy wet soils of northern europe
this led to the clearing of northern european forests and an increase in agricultural production which in turn led to an increase in population
at the same time some farmers in europe moved from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year
this resulted in increased productivity and nutrition as the change in rotations permitted nitrogenfixing legumes such as peas lentils and beans
improved horse harnesses and the whippletree further improved cultivation
watermills were introduced by the romans but were improved throughout the middle ages along with windmills and used to grind grains into flour to cut wood and to process flax and wool
crops included wheat rye barley and oats
peas beans and vetches became common from the th century onward as a fodder crop for animals and also for their nitrogenfixation fertilizing properties
crop yields peaked in the th century and stayed more or less steady until the th century
though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the middle ages recent studies have shown that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times such as the terrible weather of   that the needs of the population could not be met
after  a global exchange of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred
maize potatoes sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the new world to the old while varieties of wheat barley rice and turnips traveled from the old world to the new
there had been few livestock species in the new world with horses cattle sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with old world settlers
crops moving in both directions across the atlantic ocean caused population growth around the world and a lasting effect on many cultures in the early modern period
maize and cassava were introduced from brazil into africa by portuguese traders in the th century becoming staple foods replacing native african crops
after its introduction from south america to spain in the late s the potato became a staple crop throughout europe by the late s
the potato allowed farmers to produce more food and initially added variety to the european diet
the increased supply of food reduced disease increased births and reduced mortality causing a population boom throughout the british empire the us and europe
the introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer in the form of guano imported to europe from peru and the first artificial pesticide in the form of an arsenic compound used to fight colorado potato beetles
before the adoption of the potato as a major crop the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed including  major famines in england between  and 
the resulting dependence on the potato however caused the european potato failure a disastrous crop failure from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in ireland alone
between the th century and the midth century britain saw a large increase in agricultural productivity and net output
new agricultural practices like enclosure mechanization fourfield crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to  million in  freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce and thereby helped drive the industrial revolution
the productivity of wheat went up from  us bushels  l  us dry gal  imp gal per acre in  to around  us bushels  l  us dry gal  imp gal by  marking a major turning point in history
advice on more productive techniques for farming began to appear in england in the midth century from writers such as samuel hartlib walter blith and others
the main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients most importantly nitrogen levels in the soil
to allow the soil to regenerate productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used
the dutch fourfield rotation system was popularised by the british agriculturist charles townshend in the th century
the system wheat turnips barley and clover opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred yearround
the use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates
the mechanisation and rationalisation of agriculture was another important factor
robert bakewell and thomas coke introduced selective breeding and initiated a process of inbreeding to maximise desirable traits from the mid th century such as the new leicester sheep
machines were invented to improve the efficiency of various agricultural operation such as jethro tulls seed drill of  that mechanised seeding at the correct depth and spacing and andrew meikles threshing machine of 
ploughs were steadily improved from joseph foljambes rotherham iron plough in  to james smalls improved scots plough metal in 
in ransomes sims jefferies was producing  plough models for different soils
powered farm machinery began with richard trevithicks stationary steam engine used to drive a threshing machine in 
mechanisation spread to other farm uses through the th century
the first petroldriven tractor was built in america by john froelich in 
john bennet lawes began the scientific investigation of fertilization at the rothamsted experimental station in 
he investigated the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield and founded one of the first artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 
fertilizer in the shape of sodium nitrate deposits in chile was imported to britain by john thomas north as well as guano birds droppings
the first commercial process for fertilizer production was the obtaining of phosphate from the dissolution of coprolites in sulphuric acid
dan albone constructed the first commercially successful gasolinepowered general purpose tractor in  and the  international harvester farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals particularly horses with machines
since that time selfpropelled mechanical harvesters combines planters transplanters and other equipment have been developed further revolutionizing agriculture
these inventions allowed farming tasks to be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of highquality produce per land unit
the haberbosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints
it was first patented by german chemist fritz haber
in  carl bosch while working for german chemical company basf successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents
in the years after world war ii the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly in sync with the increasing world population
collective farming was widely practiced in the soviet union the eastern bloc countries china and vietnam starting in the s in the soviet union one result was the soviet famine of  
another consequence occurred during the great leap forward in china initiated by mao tsetung that resulted in the great chinese famine from  and ultimately reshaped the thinking of deng xiaoping
in the past century agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour water pollution and farm subsidies
other applications of scientific research since  in agriculture include gene manipulation hydroponics and the development of economically viable biofuels such as ethanol
the number of people involved in farming in industrial countries fell radically from  percent of the american population to  percent in 
the number of farms also decreased and their ownership became more concentrated for example between  and  one million pig farms in america consolidated into  with  percent of the production on factory farms
according to the worldwatch institute  percent of the worlds poultry  percent of beef and  percent of eggs are produced this way
famines however continued to sweep the globe through the th century
through the effects of climactic events government policy war and crop failure millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the s and the s
the historical processes that have allowed agricultural crops to be cultivated and eaten well beyond their centers of origin continues in the present through globalization
on average  of a nations food supplies and  of its agricultural production are of crops with foreign origins
the green revolution was a series of research development and technology transfer initiatives between the s and the late s
it increased agriculture production around the world especially from the late s
the initiatives led by norman borlaug and credited with saving over a billion people from starvation involved the development of highyielding varieties of cereal grains expansion of irrigation infrastructure modernization of management techniques distribution of hybridized seeds synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to farmers
synthetic nitrogen along with mined rock phosphate pesticides and mechanization have greatly increased crop yields in the early th century
increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well
further global yield increases were experienced later in the th century when highyield varieties of common staple grains such as rice wheat and corn were introduced as a part of the green revolution
the green revolution exported the technologies including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen of the developed world to the developing world
thomas malthus famously predicted that the earth would not be able to support its growing population but technologies such as the green revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food
although the green revolution at first significantly increased rice yields in asia yield then levelled off
the genetic yield potential has increased for wheat but the yield potential for rice has not increased since  and the yield potential for maize has barely increased in  years
it takes only a decade or two for herbicideresistant weeds to emerge and insects become resistant to insecticides within about a decade delayed somewhat by crop rotation
for most of its history agriculture has been organic without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides and without gmos
with the advent of chemical agriculture rudolf steiner called for farming without synthetic pesticides and his agriculture course of  laid the foundation for biodynamic agriculture
lord northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic farming in 
this became a worldwide movement and organic farming is now practiced in many countries
intensive agriculture also known as intensive farming as opposed to extensive farming and industrial agriculture is a type of agriculture both of crop plants and of animals with higher levels of input and output per unit of agricultural land area
it is characterized by a low fallow ratio higher use of inputs such as capital and labour and higher crop yields per unit land area
most commercial agriculture is intensive in one or more ways
forms that rely heavily on industrial methods are often called industrial agriculture which is characterised by innovations designed to increase yield
techniques include planting multiple crops per year reducing the frequency of fallow years and improving cultivars
it also involves increased use of fertilizers plant growth regulators and pesticides and mechanised agriculture controlled by increased and more detailed analysis of growing conditions including weather soil water weeds and pests
intensive farms are widespread in developed nations and increasingly prevalent worldwide
most of the meat dairy products eggs fruits and vegetables available in supermarkets are produced by such farms
some intensive farms can use sustainable methods although this may necessitate higher inputs of labor or lower yields
sustainably increasing agricultural productivity especially on smallholdings is an important way of decreasing the amount of land needed for farming and slowing environmental degradation through processes like deforestation
since agriculture has such large impacts on climate change project drawdown described sustainable intensification for smallholders an important method for climate change mitigation
intensive animal farming involves large numbers of animals raised on limited land for example by rotational grazing or in the western world sometimes as concentrated animal feeding operations
these methods increase the yields of food and fiber per acre as compared to extensive animal husbandry concentrated feed is brought to seldommoved animals or with rotational grazing the animals are repeatedly moved to fresh forage
paddybased ricefarming has been practised in korea since ancient times
a pithouse at the daecheonni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the middle jeulmun pottery period c   bc in the korean peninsula
the earliest rice cultivation there may have used dryfields instead of paddies
agricultural development in britain between the th century and the midth century saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output
this in turn contributed to unprecedented population growth freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce and thereby helped enable the industrial revolution
historians cited enclosure mechanization fourfield crop rotation and selective breeding as the most important innovations
industrial agriculture arose in the industrial revolution
by the early th century agricultural techniques implements seed stocks and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages

the industrialization phase involved a continuing process of mechanization
horsedrawn machinery such as the mccormick reaper revolutionized harvesting while inventions such as the cotton gin reduced the cost of processing
during this same period farmers began to use steampowered threshers and tractors
in  the first gasolinepowered tractor was successfully developed and in  the international harvester farmall tractor became the first allpurpose tractor marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines
mechanical harvesters combines planters transplanters and other equipment were then developed further revolutionizing agriculture
these inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms
the identification of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers further increasing crop yields
in the haberbosch method to synthesize ammonium nitrate was first demonstrated
npk fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture due to concerns that they came with side effects such as soil compaction soil erosion and declines in overall soil fertility along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply
the discovery of vitamins and their role in nutrition in the first two decades of the th century led to vitamin supplements which in the s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements
citation needed
following world war ii synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly
the discovery of antibiotics and vaccines facilitated raising livestock by reducing diseases
citation needed developments in logistics and refrigeration as well as processing technology made longdistance distribution feasible
integrated pest management is the modern method to minimize pesticide use to more sustainable levels
citation needed
there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology
pasture intensification is the improvement of pasture soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems
it is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing poor nutrient management and lack of soil conservation
this degradation leads to poor pasture soils with decreased fertility and water availability and increased rates of erosion compaction and acidification
degraded pastures have significantly lower productivity and higher carbon footprints compared to intensified pastures
management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation soil scarification and the application of lime fertilizers and pesticides
depending on the productivity goals of the target agricultural system more involved restoration projects can be undertaken to replace invasive and underproductive grasses with grass species that are better suited to the soil and climate conditions of the region
these intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter resulting in more productive carbonefficient livestock systems
another technique to optimize yield while maintaining the carbon balance is the use of integrated croplivestock icl and croplivestockforestry iclf systems which combine several ecosystems into one optimized agricultural framework
these synergies between these systems provide benefits to pastures through optimal plant usage improved feed and fattening rates increased soil fertility and quality intensified nutrient cycling integrated pest control and improved biodiversity
the introduction of certain legume crops to pastures increases carbon accumulation and nitrogen fixation in soils while their digestibility helps animal fattening and reduces methane emissions from enteric fermentation
iclf systems yield beef cattle productivity up to ten times that of degraded pastures additional crop production from maize sorghum and soybean harvests and greatly reduced greenhouse gas balances due to forest carbon sequestration
in the twelve aprils grazing program for dairy production developed by the usdasare forage crops for dairy herds are planted into a perennial pasture
rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh rested grazing areas sometimes called paddocks to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth
it can be used with cattle sheep goats pigs chickens turkeys ducks and other animals
the herds graze one portion of pasture or a paddock while allowing the others to recover
resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves rebuild shoot systems and deepen root systems resulting in longterm maximum biomass production
pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements but rotational grazing is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems
parasites are also left behind to die off minimizing or eliminating the need for dewormers
with the increased productivity of rotational systems the animals may need less supplemental feed than in continuous grazing systems
farmers can therefore increase stocking rates
intensive livestock farming or factory farming is the process of raising livestock in confinement at high stocking density
concentrated animal feeding operations cafo or intensive livestock operations can hold large numbers some up to hundreds of thousands of cows hogs turkeys or chickens often indoors
the essence of such farms is the concentration of livestock in a given space
the aim is to provide maximum output at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest level of food safety
the term is often used pejoratively
cafos have dramatically increased the production of food from animal husbandry worldwide both in terms of total food produced and efficiency
food and water is delivered to the animals and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents vitamin supplements and growth hormones are often employed
growth hormones are not used on chickens nor on any animal in the european union
undesirable behaviors often related to the stress of confinement led to a search for docile breeds eg with natural dominant behaviors bred out physical restraints to stop interaction such as individual cages for chickens or physical modification such as the debeaking of chickens to reduce the harm of fighting

the cafo designation resulted from the  us federal clean water act which was enacted to protect and restore lakes and rivers to a fishable swimmable quality
the united states environmental protection agency identified certain animal feeding operations along with many other types of industry as point source groundwater polluters
these operations were subjected to regulation
in  states in the us isolated cases of groundwater contamination were linked to cafos
for example the ten million hogs in north carolina generate  million tons of waste per year
the us federal government acknowledges the waste disposal issue and requires that animal waste be stored in lagoons
these lagoons can be as large as  acres  m
lagoons not protected with an impermeable liner can leak into groundwater under some conditions as can runoff from manure used as fertilizer
a lagoon that burst in  released  million gallons of nitrous sludge in north carolinas new river
the spill allegedly killed eight to ten million fish
the large concentration of animals animal waste and dead animals in a small space poses ethical issues to some consumers
animal rights and animal welfare activists have charged that intensive animal rearing is cruel to animals
the green revolution transformed farming in many developing countries
it spread technologies that had already existed but had not been widely used outside of industrialized nations
these technologies included miracle seeds pesticides irrigation and synthetic nitrogen fertilizer
in the s scientists created highyielding varieties of maize wheat and rice
these have an increased nitrogenabsorbing potential compared to other varieties
since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge fall over before harvest semidwarfing genes were bred into their genomes
norin  wheat a variety developed by orville vogel from japanese dwarf wheat varieties was instrumental in developing wheat cultivars
ir the first widely implemented highyielding rice to be developed by the international rice research institute was created through a cross between an indonesian variety named peta and a chinese variety named dee geo woo gen
with the availability of molecular genetics in arabidopsis and rice the mutant genes responsible reduced height rht gibberellin insensitive gai and slender rice slr have been cloned and identified as cellular signalling components of gibberellic acid a phytohormone involved in regulating stem growth via its effect on cell division
photosynthate investment in the stem is reduced dramatically in shorter plants and nutrients become redirected to grain production amplifying in particular the yield effect of chemical fertilizers
highyielding varieties outperformed traditional varieties several fold and responded better to the addition of irrigation pesticides and fertilizers
hybrid vigour is utilized in many important crops to greatly increase yields for farmers
however the advantage is lost for the progeny of the f hybrids meaning seeds for annual crops need to be purchased every season thus increasing costs and profits for farmers
crop rotation or crop sequencing is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same space in sequential seasons for benefits such as avoiding pathogen and pest buildup that occurs when one species is continuously cropped
crop rotation also seeks to balance the nutrient demands of various crops to avoid soil nutrient depletion
a traditional component of crop rotation is the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of legumes and green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops
crop rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deeprooted and shallowrooted plants
a related technique is to plant multispecies cover crops between commercial crops
this combines the advantages of intensive farming with continuous cover and polyculture
crop irrigation accounts for  of the worlds fresh water use
flood irrigation the oldest and most common type is typically unevenly distributed as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts
overhead irrigation using centerpivot or lateralmoving sprinklers gives a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern
drip irrigation is the most expensive and leastused type but delivers water to plant roots with minimal losses
water catchment management measures include recharge pits which capture rainwater and runoff and use it to recharge groundwater supplies
this helps in the replenishment of groundwater wells and eventually reduces soil erosion
dammed rivers creating reservoirs store water for irrigation and other uses over large areas
smaller areas sometimes use irrigation ponds or groundwater
in agriculture systematic weed management is usually required often performed by machines such as cultivators or liquid herbicide sprayers
herbicides kill specific targets while leaving the crop relatively unharmed
some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant hormones
weed control through herbicide is made more difficult when the weeds become resistant to the herbicide
solutions include
in agriculture a terrace is a leveled section of a hilly cultivated area designed as a method of soil conservation to slow or prevent the rapid surface runoff of irrigation water
often such land is formed into multiple terraces giving a stepped appearance
the human landscapes of rice cultivation in terraces that follow the natural contours of the escarpments like contour ploughing are a classic feature of the island of bali and the banaue rice terraces in banaue ifugao philippines
in peru the inca made use of otherwise unusable slopes by building drystone walls to create terraces

a paddy field is a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing rice and other semiaquatic crops
paddy fields are a typical feature of ricegrowing countries of east and southeast asia including malaysia china sri lanka myanmar thailand korea japan vietnam taiwan indonesia india and the philippines
they are also found in other ricegrowing regions such as piedmont italy the camargue france and the artibonite valley haiti
they can occur naturally along rivers or marshes or can be constructed even on hillsides
they require large water quantities for irrigation much of it from flooding
it gives an environment favourable to the strain of rice being grown and is hostile to many species of weeds
as the only draft animal species which is comfortable in wetlands the water buffalo is in widespread use in asian rice paddies
a recent development in the intensive production of rice is the system of rice intensification
developed in  by the french jesuit father henri de laulanié in madagascar by  the number of smallholder farmers using the system had grown to between  and  million
aquaculture is the cultivation of the natural products of water fish shellfish algae seaweed and other aquatic organisms
intensive aquaculture takes place on land using tanks ponds or other controlled systems or in the ocean using cages
intensive farming practices which are thought to be sustainable have been developed to slow the deterioration of agricultural land and even regenerate soil health and ecosystem services
these developments may fall in the category of organic farming or the integration of organic and conventional agriculture
pasture cropping involves planting grain crops directly into grassland without first applying herbicides
the perennial grasses form a living mulch understory to the grain crop eliminating the need to plant cover crops after harvest
the pasture is intensively grazed both before and after grain production
this intensive system yields equivalent farmer profits partly from increased livestock forage while building new topsoil and sequestering up to  tons of cohayear
biointensive agriculture focuses on maximizing efficiency such as per unit area energy input and water input
agroforestry combines agriculture and orchardforestry technologies to create more integrated diverse productive profitable healthy and sustainable landuse systems
intercropping can increase yields or reduce inputs and thus represents potentially sustainable agricultural intensification
however while total yield per acre is often increased yields of any single crop often diminish
there are also challenges to farmers relying on farming equipment optimized for monoculture often resulting in increased labor inputs
vertical farming is intensive crop production on a large scale in urban centers in multistory artificiallylit structures for the production of lowcalorie foods like herbs microgreens and lettuce
an integrated farming system is a progressive sustainable agriculture system such as zero waste agriculture or integrated multitrophic aquaculture which involves the interactions of multiple species
elements of this integration can include
holistic management was originally developed for reversing desertification
holistic planned grazing is similar to rotational grazing but accentuates the four principles of the water cycle the mineral cycles including the carbon cycle energy flow and ecology
when huntergatherers with growing populations depleted the stocks of game and wild foods across the near east they were forced to introduce agriculture
but agriculture brought much longer hours of work and a less rich diet than huntergatherers enjoyed
further population growth among shifting slashandburn farmers led to shorter fallow periods falling yields and soil erosion
plowing and fertilizers were introduced to deal with these problems but once again involved longer hours of work and degradation of soil resources
the challenges and issues of industrial agriculture for society for the sector and for animal rights include the costs and benefits of both current practices and proposed changes to those practices
this is a continuation of thousands of years of invention in feeding growing populations
very roughly
between  and  us agricultural productivity output divided by all inputs rose by an average of about  percent annually causing food prices to decrease
the percentage of us disposable income spent on food prepared at home decreased from  percent as late as  to  percent by the end of the century
industrial agriculture uses huge amounts of water energy and industrial chemicals increasing pollution in the arable land usable water and atmosphere
herbicides insecticides and fertilizers accumulate in ground and surface waters
industrial agricultural practices are one of the main drivers of global warming accounting for   of net greenhousegas emissions
many of the negative effects of industrial agriculture may emerge at some distance from fields and farms
nitrogen compounds from the midwest for example travel down the mississippi to degrade coastal fisheries in the gulf of mexico causing socalled oceanic dead zones
but other adverse effects show up within agricultural production systems for example the rapidly developing resistance among pests renders herbicides and insecticides increasingly ineffective
agrochemicals have been implicatedby whom
in colony collapse disorder in which the individual members of bee colonies disappear
agricultural production is highly dependent on bees to pollinate many varieties of fruits and vegetables
intensive monoculture increases the risk of failures due to pests adverse weather and disease
a study for the us office of technology assessment concluded that regarding industrial agriculture there is a negative relationship between the trend toward increasing farm size and the social conditions in rural communities on a statistical level
agricultural monoculture can entail social and economic risks
plant breeding is the science of changing the traits of plants in order to produce desired characteristics
it has been used to improve the quality of nutrition in products for humans and animals
the goals of plant breeding are to produce crop varieties that boast unique and superior traits for a variety of agricultural applications
the most frequently addressed traits are those related to biotic and abiotic stress tolerance grain or biomass yield enduse quality characteristics such as taste or the concentrations of specific biological molecules proteins sugars lipids vitamins fibers and ease of processing harvesting milling baking malting blending etc
plant breeding can be accomplished through many different techniques ranging from simply selecting plants with desirable characteristics for propagation to methods that make use of knowledge of genetics and chromosomes to more complex molecular techniques see cultigen and cultivar
genes in a plant are what determine what type of qualitative or quantitative traits it will have
plant breeders strive to create a specific outcome of plants and potentially new plant varieties
it is practiced worldwide by individuals such as gardeners and farmers and by professional plant breeders employed by organizations such as government institutions universities cropspecific industry associations or research centers
international development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important for ensuring food security by developing new varieties that are higher yielding disease resistant drought tolerant or regionally adapted to different environments and growing conditions
plant breeding started with sedentary agriculture and particularly the domestication of the first agricultural plants a practice which is estimated to date back  to  years
initially early farmers simply selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics and employed these as progenitors for subsequent generations resulting in an accumulation of valuable traits over time
grafting technology had been practiced in china before  bce
by bce grafting was well established and practiced
gregor mendel   is considered the father of genetics
his experiments with plant hybridization led to his establishing laws of inheritance
genetics stimulated research to improve crop production through plant breeding
modern plant breeding is applied genetics but its scientific basis is broader covering molecular biology cytology systematics physiology pathology entomology chemistry and statistics biometrics
it has also developed its own technology
one major technique of plant breeding is selection the process of selectively propagating plants with desirable characteristics and eliminating or culling those with less desirable characteristics
another technique is the deliberate interbreeding crossing of closely or distantly related individuals to produce new crop varieties or lines with desirable properties
plants are crossbred to introduce traitsgenes from one variety or line into a new genetic background
for example a mildewresistant pea may be crossed with a highyielding but susceptible pea the goal of the cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the highyield characteristics
progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the highyielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the highyielding parent backcrossing
the progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield selection as described above and mildew resistance and highyielding resistant plants would be further developed
plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce inbred varieties for breeding
pollinators may be excluded through the use of pollination bags
classical breeding relies largely on homologous recombination between chromosomes to generate genetic diversity
the classical plant breeder may also make use of a number of in vitro techniques such as protoplast fusion embryo rescue or mutagenesis see below to generate diversity and produce hybrid plants that would not exist in nature
traits that breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants include
successful commercial plant breeding concerns were founded from the late th century
clarification needed gartons agricultural plant breeders in england was established in the s by john garton who was one of the first to commercialize new varieties of agricultural crops created through crosspollination
the firms first introduction was abundance oat one of the first agricultural grain varieties bred from a controlled cross introduced to commerce in 
in the early th century plant breeders realized that mendels findings on the nonrandom nature of inheritance could be applied to seedling populations produced through deliberate pollinations to predict the frequencies of different types
wheat hybrids were bred to increase the crop production of italy during the socalled battle for grain  
heterosis was explained by george harrison shull
it describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents
the detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed
maize was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids
statistical methods were also developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment
in  another important breeding technique cytoplasmic male sterility cms developed in maize was described by marcus morton rhoades
cms is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile pollen
this enables the production of hybrids without the need for laborintensive detasseling
these early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the united states in the early th century
similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after world war ii the green revolution increased crop production in the developing world in the s
following world war ii a number of techniques were developed that allowed plant breeders to hybridize distantly related species and artificially induce genetic diversity
when distantly related species are crossed plant breeders make use of a number of plant tissue culture techniques to produce progeny from otherwise fruitless mating
interspecific and intergeneric hybrids are produced from a cross of related species or genera that do not normally sexually reproduce with each other
these crosses are referred to as wide crosses
for example the cereal triticale is a wheat and rye hybrid
the cells in the plants derived from the first generation created from the cross contained an uneven number of chromosomes and as a result was sterile
the cell division inhibitor colchicine was used to double the number of chromosomes in the cell and thus allow the production of a fertile line
failure to produce a hybrid may be due to pre or postfertilization incompatibility
if fertilization is possible between two species or genera the hybrid embryo may abort before maturation
if this does occur the embryo resulting from an interspecific or intergeneric cross can sometimes be rescued and cultured to produce a whole plant
such a method is referred to as embryo rescue
this technique has been used to produce new rice for africa an interspecific cross of asian rice oryza sativa and african rice oryza glaberrima
hybrids may also be produced by a technique called protoplast fusion
in this case protoplasts are fused usually in an electric field
viable recombinants can be regenerated in culture
chemical mutagens like ems and dms radiation and transposons are used to generate mutants with desirable traits to be bred with other cultivars a process known as mutation breeding
classical plant breeders also generate genetic diversity within a species by exploiting a process called somaclonal variation which occurs in plants produced from tissue culture particularly plants derived from callus
induced polyploidy and the addition or removal of chromosomes using a technique called chromosome engineering may also be used
when a desirable trait has been bred into a species a number of crosses to the favored parent are made to make the new plant as similar to the favored parent as possible
returning to the example of the mildew resistant pea being crossed with a highyielding but susceptible pea to make the mildew resistant progeny of the cross most like the highyielding parent the progeny will be crossed back to that parent for several generations see backcrossing
this process removes most of the genetic contribution of the mildew resistant parent
classical breeding is therefore a cyclical process
with classical breeding techniques the breeder does not know exactly what genes have been introduced to the new cultivars
some scientists therefore argue that plants produced by classical breeding methods should undergo the same safety testing regime as genetically modified plants
there have been instances where plants bred using classical techniques have been unsuitable for human consumption for example the poison solanine was unintentionally increased to unacceptable levels in certain varieties of potato through plant breeding
new potato varieties are often screened for solanine levels before reaching the marketplace
modern plant breeding may use techniques of molecular biology to select or in the case of genetic modification to insert desirable traits into plants
application of biotechnology or molecular biology is also known as molecular breeding
sometimes many different genes can influence a desirable trait in plant breeding
the use of tools such as molecular markers or dna fingerprinting can map thousands of genes
this allows plant breeders to screen large populations of plants for those that possess the trait of interest
the screening is based on the presence or absence of a certain gene as determined by laboratory procedures rather than on the visual identification of the expressed trait in the plant
the purpose of marker assisted selection or plant genome analysis is to identify the location and function phenotype of various genes within the genome
if all of the genes are identified it leads to genome sequence
citation neededclarification needed all plants have varying sizes and lengths of genomes with genes that code for different proteins but many are also the same
if a genes location and function is identified in one plant species a very similar gene likely can also be found in a similar location in another related species genome
clarification neededhomozygous plants with desirable traits can be produced from heterozygous starting plants if a haploid cell with the alleles for those traits can be produced and then used to make a doubled haploid
the doubled haploid will be homozygous for the desired traits
furthermore two different homozygous plants created in that way can be used to produce a generation of f hybrid plants which have the advantages of heterozygosity and a greater range of possible traits
thus an individual heterozygous plant chosen for its desirable characteristics can be converted into a heterozygous variety f hybrid without the necessity of vegetative reproduction but as the result of the cross of two homozygousdoubled haploid lines derived from the originally selected plant
plant tissue culturing can produce haploid or double haploid plant lines and generations
this cuts down the genetic diversity taken from that plant species in order to select for desirable traits that will increase the fitness of the individuals
using this method decreases the need for breeding multiple generations of plants to get a generation that is homogenous for the desired traits thereby saving much time over the natural version of the same process
there are many plant tissue culturing techniques that can be used to achieve haploid plants but microspore culturing is currently the most promising for producing the largest numbers of them
genetic modification of plants is achieved by adding a specific gene or genes to a plant or by knocking down a gene with rnai to produce a desirable phenotype
the plants resulting from adding a gene are often referred to as transgenic plants
if for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter then they are called cisgenic plants
sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits faster than classical breeding because the majority of the plants genome is not altered
to genetically modify a plant a genetic construct must be designed so that the gene to be added or removed will be expressed by the plant
to do this a promoter to drive transcription and a termination sequence to stop transcription of the new gene and the gene or genes of interest must be introduced to the plant
a marker for the selection of transformed plants is also included
in the laboratory antibiotic resistance is a commonly used marker plants that have been successfully transformed will grow on media containing antibiotics plants that have not been transformed will die
in some instances markers for selection are removed by backcrossing with the parent plant prior to commercial release
the construct can be inserted in the plant genome by genetic recombination using the bacteria agrobacterium tumefaciens or a rhizogenes or by direct methods like the gene gun or microinjection
using plant viruses to insert genetic constructs into plants is also a possibility but the technique is limited by the host range of the virus
for example cauliflower mosaic virus camv only infects cauliflower and related species
another limitation of viral vectors is that the virus is not usually passed on to the progeny so every plant has to be inoculated
the majority of commercially released transgenic plants are currently limited to plants that have introduced resistance to insect pests and herbicides
insect resistance is achieved through incorporation of a gene from bacillus thuringiensis bt that encodes a protein that is toxic to some insects
for example the cotton bollworm a common cotton pest feeds on bt cotton it will ingest the toxin and die
herbicides usually work by binding to certain plant enzymes and inhibiting their action
the enzymes that the herbicide inhibits are known as the herbicides target site
herbicide resistance can be engineered into crops by expressing a version of target site protein that is not inhibited by the herbicide
this is the method used to produce glyphosate resistant roundup ready crop plants
genetic modification can further increase yields by increasing stress tolerance to a given environment
stresses such as temperature variation are signalled to the plant via a cascade of signalling molecules which will activate a transcription factor to regulate gene expression
overexpression of particular genes involved in cold acclimation has been shown to produce more resistance to freezing which is one common cause of yield loss
genetic modification of plants that can produce pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals sometimes called pharming is a rather radical new area of plant breeding
modern plant breeding whether classical or through genetic engineering comes with issues of concern particularly with regard to food crops
the question of whether breeding can have a negative effect on nutritional value is central in this respect
although relatively little direct research in this area has been done there are scientific indications that by favoring certain aspects of a plants development other aspects may be retarded
a study published in the journal of the american college of nutrition in  entitled changes in usda food composition data for  garden crops  to  compared nutritional analysis of vegetables done in  and in  and found substantial decreases in six of  nutrients measured including  of protein and  of riboflavin
reductions in calcium phosphorus iron and ascorbic acid were also found
the study conducted at the biochemical institute university of texas at austin concluded in summary we suggest that any real declines are generally most easily explained by changes in cultivated varieties between  and  in which there may be tradeoffs between yield and nutrient content
the debate surrounding genetically modified food during the s peaked in  in terms of media coverage and risk perception and continues today for example germany has thrown its weight behind a growing european mutiny over genetically modified crops by banning the planting of a widely grown pestresistant corn variety
the debate encompasses the ecological impact of genetically modified plants the safety of genetically modified food and concepts used for safety evaluation like substantial equivalence
such concerns are not new to plant breeding
most countries have regulatory processes in place to help ensure that new crop varieties entering the marketplace are both safe and meet farmers needs
examples include variety registration seed schemes regulatory authorizations for gm plants etc
plant breeders rights is also a major and controversial issue
today production of new varieties is dominated by commercial plant breeders who seek to protect their work and collect royalties through national and international agreements based in intellectual property rights
the range of related issues is complex
in the simplest terms critics of the increasingly restrictive regulations argue that through a combination of technical and economic pressures commercial breeders are reducing biodiversity and significantly constraining individuals such as farmers from developing and trading seed on a regional level
 efforts to strengthen breeders rights for example by lengthening periods of variety protection are ongoing

when new plant breeds or cultivars are bred they must be maintained and propagated
some plants are propagated by asexual means while others are propagated by seeds
seed propagated cultivars require specific control over seed source and production procedures to maintain the integrity of the plant breeds results
isolation is necessary to prevent cross contamination with related plants or the mixing of seeds after harvesting
isolation is normally accomplished by planting distance but in certain crops plants are enclosed in greenhouses or cages most commonly used when producing f hybrids
critics of organic agriculture claim it is too lowyielding to be a viable alternative to conventional agriculture
however part of that poor performance may be the result of growing poorly adapted varieties
it is estimated that over  of organic agriculture is based on conventionally adapted varieties even though the production environments found in organic vs conventional farming systems are vastly different due to their distinctive management practices
most notably organic farmers have fewer inputs available than conventional growers to control their production environments
breeding varieties specifically adapted to the unique conditions of organic agriculture is critical for this sector to realize its full potential
this requires selection for traits such as
currently few breeding programs are directed at organic agriculture and until recently those that did address this sector have generally relied on indirect selection ie
selection in conventional environments for traits considered important for organic agriculture
however because the difference between organic and conventional environments is large a given genotype may perform very differently in each environment due to an interaction between genes and the environment see geneenvironment interaction
if this interaction is severe enough an important trait required for the organic environment may not be revealed in the conventional environment which can result in the selection of poorly adapted individuals
to ensure the most adapted varieties are identified advocates of organic breeding now promote the use of direct selection ie
selection in the target environment for many agronomic traits
there are many classical and modern breeding techniques that can be utilized for crop improvement in organic agriculture despite the ban on genetically modified organisms
for instance controlled crosses between individuals allow desirable genetic variation to be recombined and transferred to seed progeny via natural processes
marker assisted selection can also be employed as a diagnostics tool to facilitate selection of progeny who possess the desired traits greatly speeding up the breeding process
this technique has proven particularly useful for the introgression of resistance genes into new backgrounds as well as the efficient selection of many resistance genes pyramided into a single individual
unfortunately molecular markers are not currently available for many important traits especially complex ones controlled by many genes
for agriculture to thrive in the future changes must be made to address arising global issues
these issues are the lack of arable land increasingly harsh cropping conditions and the need to maintain food security which involves being able to provide the world population with sufficient nutrition
crops need to be able to mature in multiple environments to allow worldwide access which involves solving problems including drought tolerance
it has been suggested that global solutions are achievable through the process of plant breeding with its ability to select specific genes allowing crops to perform at a level which yields the desired results
with an increasing population the production of food needs to increase with it
it is estimated that a  increase in food production is needed by  in order to meet the declaration of the world summit on food security
but with the degradation of agricultural land simply planting more crops is no longer a viable option
new varieties of plants can in some cases be developed through plant breeding that generate an increase of yield without relying on an increase in land area
an example of this can be seen in asia where food production per capita has increased twofold
this has been achieved through not only the use of fertilisers but through the use of better crops that have been specifically designed for the area
plant breeding can contribute to global food security as it is a costeffective tool for increasing nutritional value of forage and crops
improvements in nutritional value for forage crops from the use of analytical chemistry and rumen fermentation technology have been recorded since  this science and technology gave breeders the ability to screen thousands of samples within a small amount of time meaning breeders could identify a high performing hybrid quicker
the genetic improvement was mainly in vitro dry matter digestibility ivdmd resulting in  increase at just  increase in ivdmd a single bos taurus also known as beef cattle reported  increase in daily gains
this improvement indicates plant breeding is an essential tool in gearing future agriculture to perform at a more advanced level
plant breeding of hybrid crops has become extremely popular worldwide in an effort to combat the harsh environment
with long periods of drought and lack of water or nitrogen stress tolerance has become a significant part of agriculture
clarification needed plant breeders have focused on identifying crops which will ensure crops perform under these conditions a way to achieve this is finding strains of the crop that is resistance to drought conditions with low nitrogen
it is evident from this that plant breeding is vital for future agriculture to survive as it enables farmers to produce stress resistant crops hence improving food security
in countries that experience harsh winters such as iceland germany and further east in europe plant breeders are involved in breeding for tolerance to frost continuous snowcover frostdrought desiccation from wind and solar radiation under frost and high moisture levels in soil in winter
participatory plant breeding ppb is when farmers are involved in a crop improvement programme with opportunities to make decisions and contribute to the research process at different stages
participatory approaches to crop improvement can also be applied when plant biotechnologies are being used for crop improvement
local agricultural systems and genetic diversity are developed and strengthened by crop improvement which participatory crop improvement pci plays a large role
ppb is enhanced by farmers knowledge of the quality required and evaluation of target environment which affects the effectiveness of ppb
subsistence agriculture occurs when farmers grow food crops to meet the needs of themselves and their families on smallholdings
subsistence agriculturalists target farm output for survival and for mostly local requirements with little or no surplus
planting decisions occur principally with an eye toward what the family will need during the coming year and only secondarily toward market prices
tony waters writes subsistence peasants are people who grow what they eat build their own houses and live without regularly making purchases in the marketplace
despite the primacy of selfsufficiency in subsistence farming todayupdate most subsistence farmers also participate in trade to some degree though usually for goods that are not necessary for survival which may include sugar iron roofingsheets bicycles used clothing and so forth
most subsistence farmers today operate in developing countries
although their amount of trade as measured in cash is less than that of consumers in countries with modern complex markets many have important trade contacts and trade items that they can produce because of their special skills or special access to resources valued in the marketplace
subsistence agriculture generally features small capitalfinance requirements mixed cropping limited use of agrochemicals eg
pesticides and fertilizer unimproved varieties of crops and animals little or no surplus yield for sale use of crudetraditional tools eg
hoes machetes and cutlasses mainly the production of food crops performed on small scattered plots of land reliance on unskilled labour often family members and generally low yields
subsistence agriculture was the dominant mode of production in the world until recently when marketbased capitalism became widespread
subsistence agriculture had largely disappeared in europe by the beginning of world war i and in north america with the movement of sharecroppers and tenant farmers out of the american south and midwest during the s and s
in central and eastern europe subsistence and semisubsistence agriculture reappeared within the transition economy since about 
subsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural africa and parts of asia and latin america
in  about  billion people slightly more than  of the worlds population in  million households living in rural areas of developing nations survive as smallholder farmers working less than  hectares  acres of land
in this type of agriculture a patch of forest land is cleared by a combination of felling chopping down and burning and crops are grown
after  years the fertility of the soil begins to decline the land is abandoned and the farmer moves to clear a fresh piece of land elsewhere in the forest as the process continues
while the land is left fallow the forest regrows in the cleared area and soil fertility and biomass is restored
after a decade or more the farmer may return to the first piece of land
this form of agriculture is sustainable at low population densities but higher population loads require more frequent clearing which prevents soil fertility from recovering opens up more of the forest canopy and encourages scrub at the expense of large trees eventually resulting in deforestation and land erosion
shifting cultivation is called dredd in india ladang in indonesia milpa in central america and mexico and jhumming in north east india
while this slashandburn technique may describe the method for opening new land commonly the farmers in question have in existence at the same time smaller fields sometimes merely gardens near the homestead there they practice intensive nonshifting techniques until shortage of fields where they can employ slash and burn to clear land and by the burning provide fertilizer ash
such gardens near the homestead often regularly receive household refuse and the manure of any household chickens or goats are initially thrown into compost piles just to get them out of the way
however such farmers often recognize the value of such compost and apply it regularly to their smaller fields
they also may irrigate part of such fields if they are near a source of water
in some areas of tropical africa at least such smaller fields may be ones in which crops are grown on raised beds
thus farmers practicing slash and burn agriculture are often much more sophisticated agriculturalists than the term slash and burn subsistence farmers suggests
in this type of farming people migrate along with their animals from one place to another in search of fodder for their animals
generally they rear cattle sheep goats camels andor yaks for milk skin meat and wool
this way of life is common in parts of central and western asia india east and southwest africa and northern eurasia
examples are the nomadic bhotiyas and gujjars of the himalayas
they carry their belongings such as tents etc on the backs of donkeys horses and camels
in mountainous regions like tibet and the andes yak and llama are reared
reindeer are the livestock in arctic and subarctic areas
sheep goats and camels are common animals and cattle and horses are also important
in intensive subsistence agriculture the farmer cultivates a small plot of land using simple tools and more labour
climate with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permits growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot
farmers use their small land holdings to produce enough for their local consumption while remaining produce is used for exchange against other goods
it results in much more food being produced per acre compared to other subsistence patterns
in the most intensive situation farmers may even create terraces along steep hillsides to cultivate rice paddies
such fields are found in densely populated parts of asia such as in the philippines
they may also intensify by using manure artificial irrigation and animal waste as fertilizer
intensive subsistence farming is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south southwest and southeast asia
subsistence agriculture can be used as a poverty alleviation strategy specifically as a safety net for foodprice shocks and for food security
poor countries are limited in fiscal and institutional resources that would allow them to contain rises in domestic prices as well as to manage social assistance programs which is often because they are using policy tools that are intended for middle and highincome countries
lowincome countries tend to have populations in which  of poor are in rural areas and more than  of rural households have access to land yet a majority of these rural poor have insufficient access to food
subsistence agriculture can be used in lowincome countries as a part of policy responses to a food crisis in the short and medium term and provide a safety net for the poor in these countries
sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways meeting societys present food and textile needs without compromising the ability for current or future generations to meet their needs
it can be based on an understanding of ecosystem services
there are many methods to increase the sustainability of agriculture
when developing agriculture within sustainable food systems it is important to develop flexible business process and farming practices
agriculture has an enormous environmental footprint playing a significant role in causing climate change water scarcity land degradation deforestation and other processes it is simultaneously causing environmental changes and being impacted by these changes
developing sustainable food systems contributes to the sustainability of the human population
for example one of the best ways to mitigate climate change is to create sustainable food systems based on sustainable agriculture
sustainable agriculture provides a potential solution to enable agricultural systems to feed a growing population within the changing environmental conditions
in  franklin h king in his book farmers of forty centuries discussed the advantages of sustainable agriculture and warned that such practices would be vital to farming in the future
the phrase sustainable agriculture was reportedly coined by the australian agronomist gordon mcclymont
the term became popular in the late s
there was an international symposium on sustainability in horticulture by the international society of horticultural science at the international horticultural congress in toronto in 
at the following conference at seoul in  the principles were discussed further
in the us national agricultural research extension and teaching policy act of  the term sustainable agriculture is defined as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a sitespecific application that will over the long term
the british scholar jules pretty has stated several key principles associated with sustainability in agriculture
it considers longterm as well as shortterm economics because sustainability is readily defined as forever that is agricultural environments that are designed to promote endless regeneration
it balances the need for resource conservation with the needs of farmers pursuing their livelihood
it is considered to be reconciliation ecology accommodating biodiversity within human landscapes
there is a debate on the definition of sustainability regarding agriculture
the definition could be characterized by two different approaches an ecocentric approach and a technocentric approach
the ecocentric approach emphasizes no or lowgrowth levels of human development and focuses on organic and biodynamic farming techniques with the goal of changing consumption patterns and resource allocation and usage
the technocentric approach argues that sustainability can be attained through a variety of strategies from the view that stateled modification of the industrial system like conservationoriented farming systems should be implemented to the argument that biotechnology is the best way to meet the increasing demand for food
one can look at the topic of sustainable agriculture through two different lenses multifunctional agriculture and ecosystem services
both of approaches are similar but look at the function of agriculture differently
those that employ the multifunctional agriculture philosophy focus on farmcentered approaches and define function as being the outputs of agricultural activity
the central argument of multifunctionality is that agriculture is a multifunctional enterprise with other functions aside from the production of food and fiber
these functions include renewable resource management landscape conservation and biodiversity
the ecosystem servicecentered approach posits that individuals and society as a whole receive benefits from ecosystems which are called ecosystem services
in sustainable agriculture the services that ecosystems provide include pollination soil formation and nutrient cycling all of which are necessary functions for the production of food
it is also claimed sustainable agriculture is best considered as an ecosystem approach to agriculture called agroecology
most agricultural professionals agree that there is a moral obligation to pursue the goal of sustainability
the major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population
practices that can cause longterm damage to soil include excessive tilling of the soil leading to erosion and irrigation without adequate drainage leading to salinization
the most important factors for a farming site are climate soil nutrients and water resources
of the four water and soil conservation are the most amenable to human intervention
when farmers grow and harvest crops they remove some nutrients from the soil
without replenishment the land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced yields
sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of nonrenewable resources such as natural gas or mineral ores
a farm that can produce perpetually yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture
an example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is the application of fertilizer or manure which can improve the productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters eutrophication
the other extreme can also be undesirable as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to rainforest destruction
in asia the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about  acres which include land for animal fodder cereal production as a cash crop and other food crops
in some cases a small unit of aquaculture is included aari
possible sources of nitrates that would in principle be available indefinitely include
the last option was proposed in the s but is only gradually becoming feasible
sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited
other options include longterm crop rotations returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands returning lost nutrients such as the flooding of the nile the longterm use of biochar and use of crop and livestock landraces that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests drought or lack of nutrients
crops that require high levels of soil nutrients can be cultivated in a more sustainable manner with appropriate fertilizer management practices
phosphate is a primary component in fertilizer
it is the second most important nutrient for plants after nitrogen and is often a limiting factor
it is important for sustainable agriculture as it can improve soil fertility and crop yields
phosphorus is involved in all major metabolic processes including photosynthesis energy transfer signal transduction macromolecular biosynthesis and respiration
it is needed for root ramification and strength and seed formation and can increase disease resistance
phosphorus is found in the soil in both inorganic and organic forms and makes up approximately  of soil biomass
phosphorus fertilizers are the main input of inorganic phosphorus in agricultural soils and approximately   of phosphorus in cultivated soils is inorganic
longterm use of phosphatecontaining chemical fertilizers causes eutrophication and deplete soil microbial life so people have looked to other sources
phosphorus fertilizers are manufactured from rock phosphate
however rock phosphate is a nonrenewable resource and it is being depleted by mining for agricultural use peak phosphorus will occur within the next few hundred years or perhaps earlier
land degradation is becoming a severe global problem
according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change about a quarter of the earths icefree land area is subject to humaninduced degradation medium confidence
soil erosion from agricultural fields is estimated to be currently  to  times no tillage to more than  times conventional tillage higher than the soil formation rate medium confidence
over a billion tonnes of southern africas soil are being lost to erosion annually which if continued will result in halving of crop yields within thirty to fifty years
improper soil management is threatening the ability to grow sufficient food
intensive agriculture reduces the carbon level in soil impairing soil structure crop growth and ecosystem functioning and accelerating climate change
soil management techniques include notill farming keyline design and windbreaks to reduce wind erosion reincorporation of organic matter into the soil reducing soil salinization and preventing water runoff
as the global population increases and demand for food increases there is pressure on land as a resource
in landuse planning and management considering the impacts of landuse changes on factors such as soil erosion can support longterm agricultural sustainability as shown by a study of wadi ziqlab a dry area in the middle east where farmers graze livestock and grow olives vegetables and grains
looking back over the th century shows that for people in poverty following environmentally sound land practices has not always been a viable option due to many complex and challenging life circumstances
currently increased land degradation in developing countries may be connected with rural poverty among smallholder farmers when forced into unsustainable agricultural practices out of necessity
converting big parts of the land surface to agriculture have severe environmental and health consequences
for example it leads to rise in zoonotic disease like the coronavirus disease  by degrading natural buffers between humans and animals reducing biodiversity and creating big groups of genetically similar animals
land is a finite resource on earth
although expansion of agricultural land can decrease biodiversity and contribute to deforestation the picture is complex for instance a study examining the introduction of sheep by norse settlers vikings to the faroe islands of the north atlantic concluded that over time the fine partitioning of land plots contributed more to soil erosion and degradation than grazing itself
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations estimates that in coming decades cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development along with reclamation of wetlands and conversion of forest to cultivation resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion
in modern agriculture energy is used in onfarm mechanisation food processing storage and transportation processes
it has therefore been found that energy prices are closely linked to food prices
oil is also used as an input in agricultural chemicals
the international energy agency projects higher prices of nonrenewable energy resources as a result of fossil fuel resources being depleted
it may therefore decrease global food security unless action is taken to decouple fossil fuel energy from food production with a move towards energysmart agricultural systems including renewable energy
the use of solar powered irrigation in pakistan is said to be a closed system for agricultural water irrigation
also in a hot climate and ocean acidification scenario with fisheries substantially depleted it will be increasingly necessary to cool chicken houses and other farm buildings
using solar and wind power for this required cooling and sanitation offers a more sustainable path to meat egg dairy and other protein and mineralrich food production
the environmental cost of transportation could be avoided if people use local products
in some areas sufficient rainfall is available for crop growth but many other areas require irrigation
for irrigation systems to be sustainable they require proper management to avoid salinization and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable
otherwise the water source effectively becomes a nonrenewable resource
improvements in water well drilling technology and submersible pumps combined with the development of drip irrigation and lowpressure pivots have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable
however this progress has come at a price
in many areas such as the ogallala aquifer the water is being used faster than it can be replenished
according to the uc davis agricultural sustainability institute several steps must be taken to develop droughtresistant farming systems even in normal years with average rainfall
these measures include both policy and management actions
indicators for sustainable water resource development include the average annual flow of rivers from rainfall flows from outside a country the percentage of water coming from outside a country and gross water withdrawal
costs such as environmental problems not covered in traditional accounting systems which take into account only the direct costs of production incurred by the farmer are known as externalities
netting studied sustainability and intensive agriculture in smallholder systems through history
there are several studies incorporating externalities such as ecosystem services biodiversity land degradation and sustainable land management in economic analysis
these include the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity study and the economics of land degradation initiative which seek to establish an economic costbenefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management and sustainable agriculture
triple bottom line frameworks include social and environmental alongside a financial bottom line
a sustainable future can be feasible if growth in material consumption and population is slowed down and if there is a drastic increase in the efficiency of material and energy use
to make that transition long and shortterm goals will need to be balanced enhancing equity and quality of life
other practices include growing a diverse number of perennial crops in a single field each of which would grow in separate season so as not to compete with each other for natural resources
this system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in soil
nitrogen fixation from legumes for example used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from soil for growth helps to allow the land to be reused annually
legumes will grow for a season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest
sustainable methods of weed management may help reduce the development of herbicideresistant weeds
crop rotation may also replenish nitrogen if legumes are used in the rotations and may also use resources more efficiently
there are also many ways to practice sustainable animal husbandry
some of the tools to grazing management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called paddocks lowering stock density and moving the stock between paddocks frequently
an increased production is a goal of intensification
sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes
the desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost
sustainable intensification has become a priority for the united nations
sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes
by the year  it was predicted in  nations a combined total of  million farms used sustainable intensification
the amount of agricultural land covered by this is  million ha of land
that amount of land is equal to  of farms worldwide
in light of concerns about food security human population growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high crop yields while maintaining soil health and ecosystem services
the capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of nonrenewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate
recent work in irrigated rice production system of east asia has suggested that in relation to pest management at least promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by  whilst delivering a  yield advantage compared with standard practice
vertical farming is a concept with the potential advantages of yearround production isolation from pests and diseases controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs
water efficiency can be improved by reducing the need for irrigation and using alternative methods
such methods includes researching on drought resistant crops monitoring plant transpiration and reducing soil evaporation
drought resistant crops have been researched extensively as a means to overcome the issue of water shortage
they are modified genetically so they can adapt in an environment with little water
this is beneficial as it reduces the need for irrigation and helps conserve water
although they have been extensively researched significant results have not been achieved as most of the successful species will have no overall impact on water conservation
however some grains like rice for example have been successfully genetically modified to be drought resistant
soil amendments include using compost from recycling centers
using compost from yard and kitchen waste uses available resources in the area
abstinence from soil tillage before planting and leaving the plant residue after harvesting reduces soil water evaporation it also serves to prevent soil erosion
crop residues left covering the surface of the soil may result in reduced evaporation of water a lower surface soil temperature and reduction of wind effects
a way to make rock phosphate more effective is to add microbial inoculates such as phosphatesolubilizing microorganisms known as psms to the soil
these solubilize phosphorus already in the soil and use processes like organic acid production and ion exchange reactions to make that phosphorus available for plants
experimentally these psms have been shown to increase crop growth in terms of shoot height dry biomass and grain yield
phosphorus uptake is even more efficient with the presence of mycorrhizae in the soil
mycorrhiza is a type of mutualistic symbiotic association between plants and fungi which are wellequipped to absorb nutrients including phosphorus in soil
these fungi can increase nutrient uptake in soil where phosphorus has been fixed by aluminum calcium and iron
mycorrhizae can also release organic acids that solubilize otherwise unavailable phosphorus
soil steaming can be used as an alternative to chemicals for soil sterilization
different methods are available to induce steam into the soil to kill pests and increase soil health
solarizing is based on the same principle used to increase the temperature of the soil to kill pathogens and pests
certain plants can be cropped for use as biofumigants natural fumigants releasing pest suppressing compounds when crushed ploughed into the soil and covered in plastic for four weeks
plants in the brassicaceae family release large amounts of toxic compounds such as methyl isothiocyanates
sustainability may also involve crop rotation
crop rotation and cover crops prevent soil erosion by protecting topsoil from wind and water
effective crop rotation can reduce pest pressure on crops and replenish soil nutrients
this reduces the need for fertilizers and pesticides
increasing the diversity of crops by introducing new genetic resources can increase yields
perennial crops reduce the need for tillage and thus help mitigate soil erosion and may sometimes tolerate drought better increase water quality and help increase soil organic matter
there are research programs attempting to develop perennial substitutes for existing annual crops such as replacing wheat with the wild grass thinopyrum intermedium or possible experimental hybrids of it and wheat
often thought of as inherently destructive slashandburn or slashandchar shifting cultivation have been practised in the amazon for thousands of years
some traditional systems combine polyculture with sustainability
in southeast asia ricefish systems on rice paddies have raised freshwater fish as well as rice producing an additional product and reducing eutrophication of neighbouring rivers
a variant in indonesia combines rice fish ducks and water fern the ducks eat the weeds that would otherwise limit rice growth saving labour and herbicides while the duck and fish manure substitute for fertilizer
raised field agriculture has been recently revived in certain areas of the world such as the altiplano region in bolivia and peru
this has resurged in the form of traditional waru waru raised fields which create nutrientrich soil in regions where such soil is scarce
this method is extremely productive and has recently been utilized by indigenous groups in the area and the nearby amazon basin to make use of lands that have been historically hard to cultivate
in ohio some farmers that could not buy land good for agriculture restored soil considered as unsuitable for any agricultural activity with traditional methods
the use of available city space eg rooftop gardens community gardens garden sharing and other forms of urban agriculture may be able to contribute to sustainability
there is limited evidence polyculture may contribute to sustainable agriculture
a metaanalysis of a number of polycrop studies found that predator insect biodiversity was higher at comparable yields than conventional in certain twocrop systems with a single cash crop combined with a cover crop
one approach to sustainability is to develop polyculture systems using perennial crop varieties
such varieties are being developed for rice wheat sorghum barley and sunflowers
if these can be combined in polyculture with a leguminous cover crop such as alfalfa fixation of nitrogen will be added to the system reducing the need for fertilizer and pesticides
organic agriculture can be defined as
an integrated farming system that strives for sustainability the enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity whilst with rare exceptions prohibiting synthetic pesticides antibiotics synthetic fertilizers genetically modified organisms and growth hormones
some claim organic agriculture may produce the most sustainable products available for consumers in the us where no other alternatives exist although the focus of the organics industry is not sustainability
in the sales of organic products in usa reach  billion according to a big survey two thirds of americans consume organic products at least occasionally
regenerative agriculture is a conservation and rehabilitation approach to food and farming systems
it focuses on topsoil regeneration increasing biodiversity improving the water cycle enhancing ecosystem services supporting biosequestration increasing resilience to climate change and strengthening the health and vitality of farm soil
practices include recycling as much farm waste as possible and adding composted material from sources outside the farm
permaculture is an approach to land management and philosophy that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems
it includes a set of design principles derived using whole systems thinking
it uses these principles in fields such as regenerative agriculture rewilding and community resilience
permaculture was originally a portmanteau of permanent agriculture but was later adjusted to permanent culture to incorporate necessary social aspects as inspired by masanobu fukuokas natural farming
the term was coined by bill mollison and david holmgren in  who formulated the concept in opposition to western industrialized methods and in congruence with indigenous or traditional knowledge
in the united nations reported on organic agriculture and food security in africa stating that using sustainable agriculture could be a tool in reaching global food security without expanding land usage and reducing environmental impacts
there has been evidence provided by developing nations from the early s stating that when people in their communities are not factored into the agricultural process that serious harm is done
the social scientist charles kellogg has stated that in a final effort exploited people pass their suffering to the land
sustainable agriculture mean the ability to permanently and continuously feed its constituent populations
there are a lot of opportunities that can increase farmers profits improve communities and continue sustainable practices
for example in uganda genetically modified organisms were originally illegal however with the stress of banana crisis in uganda where banana bacterial wilt had the potential to wipe out  of yield they decided to explore gmos as a possible solution
the government issued the national biotechnology and biosafety bill which will allow scientists that are part of the national banana research program to start experimenting with genetically modified organisms
this effort has the potential to help local communities because a significant portion live off the food they grow themselves and it will be profitable because the yield of their main produce will remain stable
not all regions are suitable for agriculture
the technological advancement of the past few decades has allowed agriculture to develop in some of these regions
for example nepal has built greenhouses to deal with its high altitude and mountainous regions
greenhouses allow for greater crop production and also use less water since they are closed systems
desalination techniques can turn salt water into fresh water which allows greater access to water for areas with a limited supply
this allows the irrigation of crops without decreasing natural fresh water sources
while desalination can be a tool to provide water to areas that need it to sustain agriculture it requires money and resources
regions of china have been considering large scale desalination in order to increase access to water but the current cost of the desalination process makes it impractical
women working in sustainable agriculture come from numerous backgrounds from academic and labour
in the past  years  in the united states the number of women farm operators has tripled
today women operate  percent of farms compared to five percent in 
much of the growth is due to women farming outside the male dominated field of conventional agriculture
the practice of growing food in the backyard of houses schools etc by families or by communities became widespread in the us at the time of world war one the great recession and world war two so that in one point of time  of the vegetables of the usa was produced in this way
the practice became more popular again in the time of the covid pandemic
this method permits to grow food in a relatively sustainable way and at the same time make easier for poor people to obtain food
sustainable agriculture is a topic in international policy concerning its potential to reduce environmental risks
in the commission on sustainable agriculture and climate change as part of its recommendations for policymakers on achieving food security in the face of climate change urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy
the commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience
it also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade including in national research and development budgets land rehabilitation economic incentives and infrastructure improvement
in may  the european union published a program named from farm to fork for making its agriculture more sustainable
in the official page of the program from farm to fork is cited frans timmermans the executive vicepresident of the european commission saying that
the coronavirus crisis has shown how vulnerable we all are and how important it is to restore the balance between human activity and nature
at the heart of the green deal the biodiversity and farm to fork strategies point to a new and better balance of nature food systems and biodiversity to protect our peoples health and wellbeing and at the same time to increase the eus competitiveness and resilience
these strategies are a crucial part of the great transition we are embarking upon
the program includes the next targets
in the chinese government adopted a plan to reduce chinas meat consumption by  for achieving more sustainable and healthy food system
in the united states the federal natural resources conservation service provides technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation along with production agriculture
with programs like sare and chinauk sustainable agriculture innovation network to help promote research on sustainable agriculture practices and a framework for agriculture and climate change respectively
in mexico banned the domestic growing of gmo corn and announced a future ban on import by 
according to the announcement the use of glyphosate will also be banned by the same year
among  farmers interviewed in tasmania most accepted the notion climate change was happening but just a small segment believed that it was humanrelated
few farmers thought that the issue of climate change was significant enough to diminish what was causing it
some of the farmers were worried about how a suggested carbon dioxide reduction plan would affect the agricultural sector and were suspicious of numerous government related activities seeing them as methods in which the government could punish producers
the author james howard kunstler claims almost all modern technology is bad and that there can not be sustainability unless agriculture is done in ancient traditional ways
efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community however these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end
some foresee a true sustainable steady state economy that may be very different from todays greatly reduced energy usage minimal ecological footprint fewer consumer packaged goods local purchasing with short food supply chains little processed foods more home and community gardens etc
according to michael carolan a major barrier to the adoption of sustainable agriculture is its appearance of a lack of benefits
many benefits are not visible or immediately evident and affecting changes such as lower rates of soil and nutrient loss improved soil structure and higher levels of beneficial microorganisms takes time
in conventional agriculture the benefits are easily visible with no weeds pests etcand the costs to soil and ecosystems around it are hidden and externalised
