a building or edifice is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place such as a house or factory
buildings come in a variety of sizes shapes and functions and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors from building materials available to weather conditions land prices ground conditions specific uses and aesthetic reasons
to better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures
buildings serve several societal needs primarily as shelter from weather security living space privacy to store belongings and to comfortably live and work
a building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat a place of comfort and safety and the outside a place that at times may be harsh and harmful
ever since the first cave paintings buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression
in recent years interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings and other structures
the word building is both a noun and a verb the structure itself and the act of making it
as a noun a building is a structure that has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place there was a threestorey building on the corner it was an imposing edifice
in the broadest interpretation a fence or wall is a building
however the word structure is used more broadly than building including natural and manmade formations and does not necessarily have walls
structure is more likely to be used for a fence
sturgis dictionary included that building differs from architecture in excluding all idea of artistic treatment and it differs from construction in the idea of excluding scientific or highly skilful treatment
as a verb building is the act of construction
structural height in technical usage is the height to the highest architectural detail on building from streetlevel
depending on how they are classified spires and masts may or may not be included in this height
spires and masts used as antennas are not generally included
the definition of a lowrise vs a highrise building is a matter of debate but generally three storeys or less is considered lowrise
there is clear evidence of homebuilding from around  bc
buildings became common during the neolithic see neolithic architecture
singlefamily residential buildings are most often called houses or homes
multifamily residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called a duplex or an apartment building
a condominium is an apartment that the occupant owns rather than rents
houses may also be built in pairs semidetached in terraces where all but two of the houses have others either side apartments may be built round courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by a piece of ground of varying sizes
houses which were built as a single dwelling may later be divided into apartments or bedsitters they may also be converted to another use eg
an office or a shop
building types may range from huts to multimilliondollar highrise apartment blocks able to house thousands of people
increasing settlement density in buildings and smaller distances between buildings is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from many people wanting to live close to work or similar attractors
other common building materials are brick concrete or combinations of either of these with stone
residential buildings have different names for their use depending if they are seasonal include holiday cottage vacation home or timeshare size such as a cottage or great house value such as a shack or mansion manner of construction such as a log home or mobile home proximity to the ground such as earth sheltered house stilt house or tree house
also if the residents are in need of special care such as a nursing home orphanage or prison or in group housing like barracks or dormitories
historically many people lived in communal buildings called longhouses smaller dwellings called pithouses and houses combined with barns sometimes called housebarns
buildings are defined to be substantial permanent structures so other dwelling forms such as houseboats yurts and motorhomes are dwellings but not buildings
sometimes a group of interrelated and possibly interconnected builds are referred to as a complex for example a housing complex educational complex hospital complex etc
the practice of designing constructing and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of professionals and trades
depending on the size complexity and purpose of a particular building project the project team may include
regardless of their size or intended use all buildings in the us must comply with zoning ordinances building codes and other regulations such as fire codes life safety codes and related standards
vehicles such as trailers caravans ships and passenger aircraft are treated as buildings for life safety purposes
any building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function which includes such elements like heating cooling power and telecommunications water and wastewater etc
especially in commercial buildings such as offices or factories these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space sometimes located in separate areas or double floors false ceilings and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required
systems for transport of people within buildings
systems for transport of people between interconnected buildings
buildings may be damaged during the construction of the building or during maintenance
there are several other reasons behind building damage like accidents such as storms explosions subsidence caused by mining water withdrawal or poor foundations and landslides
 buildings also may suffer from fire damage and flooding in special circumstances
they may also become dilapidated through lack of proper maintenance or alteration work improperly carried out

carpentry is a skilled trade and a craft in which the primary work performed is the cutting shaping and installation of building materials during the construction of buildings ships timber bridges concrete formwork etc
carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did rougher work such as framing but today many other materials are also used and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture building are considered carpentry
in the united states  of carpenters are male and it was the fourth most maledominated occupation in the country in 
in  in the united states there were about  million carpentry positions
carpenters are usually the first tradesmen on a job and the last to leave
carpenters normally framed postandbeam buildings until the end of the th century now this oldfashioned carpentry is called timber framing
carpenters learn this trade by being employed through an apprenticeship training normally  years and qualify by successfully completing that countrys competence test in places such as the united kingdom the united states canada switzerland australia and south africa
it is also common that the skill can be learned by gaining work experience other than a formal training program which may be the case in many places
the word carpenter is the english rendering of the old french word carpentier later charpentier which is derived from the latin carpentarius artifex maker of a carriage  the middle english and scots word in the sense of builder was wright from the old english wryhta cognate with work which could be used in compound forms such as wheelwright or boatwright
in the uk carpentry is more correctly used to describe the skill involved in first fixing of timber items such as construction of roofs floors and timber framed buildings ie
those areas of construction that are normally hidden in a finished building
an easy way to envisage this is that first fix work is all that is done before plastering takes place
the second fix is done after plastering takes place
second fix work the installation of items such as skirting boards architraves doors and windows are generally regarded as carpentry however the offsite manufacture and prefinishing of the items is regarded as joinery
carpentry is also used to construct the formwork into which concrete is poured during the building of structures such as roads and highway overpasses
in the uk the skill of making timber formwork for poured or in situ concrete is referred to as shuttering
carpentry in the united states is historically defined similarly to the united kingdom as the heavier and stronger  work distinguished from a joiner who does lighter and more ornamental work than that of a carpenter although the work of a carpenter and joiner are often combined  joiner is less common than the terms finish carpenter or cabinetmaker
the terms housewright and barn right were used historically now occasionally used by carpenters who work using traditional methods and materials
someone who builds custom concrete formwork is a form carpenter
wood is one of mankinds oldest building materials
the ability to shape wood improved with technological advances from the stone age to the bronze age to the iron age
some of the oldest archaeological evidence of carpentry are water well casings
these include an oak and hazel structure dating from  bc found in ostrov czech republic and one built using split oak timbers with mortise and tenon and notched corners excavated in eastern germany dating from about  years ago in the early neolithic period
relatively little information about carpentry is available from prehistory before written language or even recent centuries because the knowledge and skills were passed down person to person rarely in writing until the printing press was invented in the th century and builders began regularly publishing guides and pattern books in the th and th centuries
the oldest surviving complete architectural text is vitruvius ten books collectively titled de architectura which discuss some carpentry
some of the oldest surviving wooden buildings in the world are temples in china such as the nanchan temple builtin  the greensted church parts of which are from the th century and the stave churches in norway from the th and th centuries
by the th century sawmills were coming into use in europe
the founding of america was partly based on a desire to extract resources from the new continent including wood for use in ships and buildings in europe
in the th century part of the industrial revolution was the invention of the steam engine and cut nails
these technologies combined with the invention of the circular saw led to the development of balloon framing which was the beginning of the decline of traditional timber framingthe th century saw the development of electrical engineering and distribution which allowed the development of handheld power tools wire nails and machines to massproduce screws
in the th century portland cement came into common use and concrete foundations allowed carpenters to do away with heavy timber sills
also drywall plasterboard came into common use replacing lime plaster on wooden lath
plywood engineered lumber and chemically treated lumber also came into use
for types of carpentry used in america see american historic carpentry
carpentry requires training which involves both acquiring knowledge and physical practice
in formal training a carpenter begins as an apprentice then becomes a journeyman and with enough experience and competency can eventually attain the status of a master carpenter
today preapprenticeship training may be gained through nonunion vocational programs such as high school shop classes and community colleges
informally a laborer may simply work alongside carpenters for years learning skills by observation and peripheral assistance
while such an individual may obtain journeyman status by paying the union entry fee and obtaining a journeymans card which provides the right to work on a union carpentry crew the carpenter foreman will by necessity dismiss any worker who presents the card but does not demonstrate the expected skill level
carpenters may work for an employer or be selfemployed
no matter what kind of training a carpenter has had some us states require contractors to be licensed which requires passing a written test and having minimum levels of insurance
formal training in the carpentry trade is available in seminars certificate programs highschool programs online classes in the new construction restoration and preservation carpentry fields
sometimes these programs are called preapprenticeship training
in the modern british construction industry carpenters are trained through apprenticeship schemes where general certificates of secondary education gcse in mathematics english and technology help but are not essential
however this is deemed the preferred route as young people can earn and gain field experience whilst training towards a nationally recognized qualification
there are two main divisions of training constructioncarpentry and cabinetmaking
during preapprenticeship trainees in each of these divisions spend  hours a week for  weeks in classrooms and indoor workshops learning mathematics trade terminology and skill in the use of hand and power tools
constructioncarpentry trainees also participate in calisthenics to prepare for the physical aspect of the work
upon completion of preapprenticeship trainees who have successfully passed the graded curriculum taught by highly experienced journeyman carpenters are assigned to a local union and to union carpentry crews at work on construction sites or in cabinet shops as first year apprentices
over the next four years as they progress in status to second year third year and fourth year apprentice apprentices periodically return to the training facility every three months for a week of more detailed training in specific aspects of the trade
tradesmen in countries such as germany and australia are required to fulfill a formal apprenticeship usually three to four years to work as a professional carpenter
upon graduation from the apprenticeship he or she is known as a journeyman carpenter
up through the th and even the early th century the journeyman traveled to another region of the country to learn the building styles and techniques of that area before usually returning home
in modern times journeymen are not required to travel and the term now refers to a level of proficiency and skill
union carpenters in the united states that is members of the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america are required to pass a skills test to be granted official journeyman status but uncertified professional carpenters may also be known as journeymen based on their skill level years of experience or simply because they support themselves in the trade and not due to any certification or formal woodworking education
professional status as a journeyman carpenter in the united states may be obtained in a number of ways
formal training is acquired in a fouryear apprenticeship program administered by the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america in which journeyman status is obtained after successful completion of twelve weeks of preapprenticeship training followed by four years of onthejob field training working alongside journeyman carpenters
the timber framers guild also has a formal apprenticeship program for traditional timber framing
training is also available in groups like the kim bồng woodworking village in vietnam where apprentices live and work to learn woodworking and carpentry skills
in canada each province sets its own standards for apprenticeship
the average length of time is four years and includes a minimum number of hours of both onthejob training and technical instruction at a college or other institution
depending on the number of hours of instruction an apprentice receives he or she can earn a certificate of proficiency making him or her a journeyman or a certificate of qualification which allows him or her to practice a more limited amount of carpentry
canadian carpenters also have the option of acquiring an additional interprovincial red seal that allows them to practice anywhere in canada
the red seal requires the completion of an apprenticeship and an additional examination
after working as a journeyman for a while a carpenter may go on to study or test as a master carpenter
in some countries such as germany iceland and japan this is an arduous and expensive process requiring extensive knowledge including economic and legal knowledge and skill to achieve master certification these countries generally require master status for anyone employing and teaching apprentices in the craft
in others like the united states master carpenter can be a loosely used term to describe any skilled carpenter
fully trained carpenters and joiners will often move into related trades such as shop fitting scaffolding bench joinery maintenance and system installation
carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood which has been prepared by splitting riving hewing or sawing with a pit saw or sawmill called lumber american english or timber british english
today natural and engineered lumber and many other building materials carpenters may use are typically prepared by others and delivered to the job site
in  the carpenters union in america used the term carpenter for a catchall position
tasks performed by union carpenters include installing flooring windows doors interior trim cabinetry solid surface roofing framing siding flooring insulation acoustical ceilings computeraccess flooring metal framing wall partitions office furniture systems and both custom or factoryproduced materials trim and molding ceiling treatments exposed columns and beams displays mantels staircasesmetal studs metal lath and drywall
carpentry is often hazardous work
types of woodworking and carpentry hazards include machine hazards flying materials tool projection fire and explosion electrocution noise vibration dust and chemicals
in the united states the occupational safety and health administration osha tries to prevent illness injury and fire through regulations
however selfemployed workers are not covered by the osha act
osha claims that since  workplace fatalities have been reduced by more than  percent and occupational injury and illness rates have declined by  percent
at the same time us employment has almost doubled
the leading cause of overall fatalities called the fatal four are falls followed by struck by object electrocution and caughtinbetween
in general construction employers must provide working conditions that are free of known dangers
keep floors in work areas in a clean and so far as possible dry condition
select and provide required personal protective equipment at no cost to workers
train workers about job hazards in a language that they can understand
examples of how to prevent falls includes placing railings and toeboards at any floor opening which can not be well covered and elevated platforms and safety harness and lines safety nets stair railings and handrails
safety is not just about the workers on the job site
carpenters work needs to meet the requirements in the life safety code such as in stair building and building codes to promote longterm quality and safety for the building occupants
construction is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects systems or organizations and comes from latin constructio from com together and struere to pile up and old french construction
to construct is the verb the act of building and the noun is construction how something is built the nature of its structure
in its most widely used context construction covers the processes involved in delivering buildings infrastructure and industrial facilities and associated activities through to the end of their life
it typically starts with planning financing and design and continues until the asset is built and ready for use construction also covers repairs and maintenance work any works to expand extend and improve the asset and its eventual demolition dismantling or decommissioning
as an industry construction accounts for more than  of global gdp  in developed countries and employs around  of the global workforce over m people
the output of the global construction industry was worth an estimated  trillion in 
the first huts and shelters were constructed by hand or with simple tools
as cities grew during the bronze age a class of professional craftsmen like bricklayers and carpenters appeared
occasionally slaves were used for construction work
in the middle ages the artisan craftsmen were organized into guilds
in the th century steampowered machinery appeared and later diesel and electricpowered vehicles such as cranes excavators and bulldozers
fasttrack construction has been increasingly popular in the st century
some estimates suggest that  of construction projects are now fasttrack construction
broadly there are three sectors of construction buildings infrastructure and industrial
the industry can also be classified into sectors or markets
for example engineering newsrecord enr a usbased construction trade magazine has compiled and reported data about the size of design and construction contractors
in  it split the data into nine market segments transportation petroleum buildings power industrial water manufacturing sewerwaste telecom hazardous waste and a tenth category for other projects
enr used data on transportation sewer hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors
the standard industrial classification and the newer north american industry classification system classify companies that perform or engage in construction into three subsectors building construction heavy and civil engineering construction and specialty trade contractors
there are also categories for professional services firms eg engineering architecture surveying project management
building construction is the process of adding structures to areas of land also known as real property sites
typically a project is instigated by or with the owner of the property who may be an individual or an organisation occasionally land may be compulsorily purchased from the owner for public use
residential construction may be undertaken by individual landowners selfbuild by specialist housebuilders by property developers by general contractors or by providers of public or social housing eg local authorities housing associations
where local zoning or planning policies allow mixeduse developments may comprise both residential and nonresidential construction eg retail leisure offices public buildings etc
residential construction practices technologies and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice
materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used eg brick versus stone versus timber
costs of construction on a per square meter or per square foot basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions access routes local regulations economies of scale customdesigned homes are often more expensive to build and the availability of skilled tradespeople
depending upon the type of building nonresidential building construction can be procured by a wide range of private and public organisations including local authorities educational and religious bodies transport undertakings retailers hoteliers property developers financial institutions and other private companies
most construction in these sectors is undertaken by general contractors
civil engineering covers the design construction and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment including public works such as roads bridges canals dams tunnels airports water and sewerage systems pipelines and railways
some general contractors have expertise in civil engineering civil engineering contractors are firms dedicated to work in this sector and may specialise in particular types of infrastructure
industrial construction includes offshore construction mainly of energy installations oil and gas platforms wind power mining and quarrying refineries breweries distilleries and other processing plants power stations steel mills warehouses and factories
some construction projects are small renovations or repair jobs where the owner may act as designer paymaster and laborer for the entire project
however more complex or ambitious projects usually require additional multidisciplinary expertise and manpower so the owner may commission one or more specialist businesses to undertake detailed planning design construction and handover of the work
often the owner will appoint one business to oversee the project this may be a designer a contractor a construction manager or other advisor such specialists are normally appointed for their expertise in project delivery and will help the owner define the project brief agree a budget and schedule liaise with relevant public authorities and procure the services of other specialists the supply chain comprising subcontractors
contracts are agreed for the delivery of services by all businesses alongside other detailed plans aimed at ensuring legal timely onbudget and safe delivery of the specified works
design finance and legal aspects overlap and interrelate
the design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location but must also be financially possible to build and legal to use
the financial structure must be adequate to build the design provided and must pay amounts that are legally owed
legal structures integrate design with other activities and enforce financial and other construction processes
these processes also affect procurement strategies
clients may for example appoint a business to design the project after which a competitive process is undertaken to appoint a lead contractor to construct the asset design bid build they may appoint a business to lead both design and construction designbuild or they may directly appoint a designer contractor and specialist subcontractors construction management
some forms of procurement emphasise collaborative relationships partnering alliancing between the client the contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project seeking to ameliorate often highly competitive and adversarial industry practices
when applicable a proposed construction project must comply with local landuse planning policies including zoning and building code requirements
a project will normally be assessed by the authority having jurisdiction ahj typically the municipality where the project will be located for its potential impacts on neighbouring properties and upon existing infrastructure transportation social infrastructure and utilities including water supply sewerage electricity telecommunications etc
data may be gathered through site analysis site surveys and geotechnical investigations
construction normally can not start until planning permission has been granted and may require preparatory work to ensure relevant infrastructure has been upgraded before building work can commence
preparatory works will also include surveys of existing utility lines to avoid damage causing outages and other hazardous situations
some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations or the desire to prevent indisputably bad phenomena eg
explosions or bridge collapses
other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations or factors that are a matter of custom or expectation such as isolating businesses from a business district or residences from a residential district
an attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable the bridge design will not cause a collapse or that the custom is no longer needed acceptance of livework spaces has grown in the community
during construction of a building a municipal building inspector usually inspects the ongoing work periodically to ensure that construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code
once construction is complete any later changes made to a building or other asset that affect safety including its use expansion structural integrity and fire protection usually require municipality approval
depending on the type of project mortgage bankers accountants and cost engineers may participe in creating an overall plan for the financial management of a construction project
the presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely even in relatively small projects since the owners equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project
accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process
professionals including cost engineers estimators and quantity surveyors apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation
financial planning ensures adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and ensures that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project
construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems
underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project
cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding can not cover the current costs for labour and materials such problems may arise even when the overall budget is adequate presenting a temporary issue
cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid
fraud is also an occasional construction issue
large projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with a conceptual estimate performed by a building estimator
as portions of a project are completed they may be sold supplanting one lender or owner for another while the logistical requirements of having the right trades and materials available for each stage of the building construction project carries forward
public private partnerships ppps or private finance initiatives pfis may also be used to help delivery major projects
according to mckinsey in  the vast majority of large construction projects go over budget and take  longer than expected
a construction project is a complex net of construction contracts and other legal obligations each of which all parties must carefully consider
a contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties and provides structures to manage issues
for example construction delays can be costly so construction contracts set out clear expectations and clear paths to manage delays
poorly drafted contracts can lead to confusion and costly disputes
at the start of a project legal advisors seek to identify ambiguities and other potential sources of trouble in the contract structures and to present options for preventing problems
during projects they work to avoid and resolve conflicts that arise
in each case the lawyer facilitates an exchange of obligations that matches the reality of the project
designbidbuild is the most common and wellestablished method of construction procurement
in this arrangement the architect engineer or builder acts for the client as the project coordinator
they design the works prepare specifications and design deliverables models drawings etc administer the contract tender the works and manage the works from inception to completion
in parallel there are direct contractual links between the client and the main contractor who in turn has direct contractual relationships with subcontractors
the arrangement continues until the project is ready for handover
designbuild became more common from the late th century and involves the client contracting a single entity to provide design and construction
in some cases the designbuild package can also include finding the site arranging funding and applying for all necessary statutory consents
typically the client invites several db contractors to submit proposals to meet the project brief and then selects a preferred supplier
often this will be a consortium involving a design firm and a contractor sometimes more than one of each
in the united states departments of transportation usually use designbuild contracts as a way of progressing projects where states lack the skills or resources particularly for very large projects
in a construction management arrangement the client enters into separate contracts with the designer architect or engineer a construction manager and individual trade contractors
the client takes on the contractual role while the construction or project manager provides the active role of managing the separate trade contracts and ensuring that they complete all work smoothly and effectively together
this approach is often used to speed up procurement processes to allow the client greater flexibility in design variation throughout the contract to enable the appointment of individual work contractors to separate contractual responsibility on each individual throughout the contract and to provide greater client control
in the industrialized world construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality
most commonly ie in a designbidbuild project the design team is employed by ie
in contract with the property owner
depending upon the type of project a design team may include architects civil engineers mechanical engineers electrical engineers structural engineers fire protection engineers planning consultants architectural consultants and archaeological consultants
a lead designer will normally be identified to help coordinate different disciplinary inputs to the overall design
this may be aided by integration of previously separate disciplines often undertaken by separate firms into multidisciplinary firms with experts from all related fields or by firms establishing relationships to support designbuild processes
the increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design professionals trained in all phases of a projects lifecycle and develop an appreciation of the asset as an advanced technological system requiring close integration of many subsystems and their individual components including sustainability
for buildings building engineering is an emerging discipline that attempts to meet this new challenge
traditionally design has involved the production of sketches architectural and engineering drawings and specifications
until the late th century drawings were largely handdrafted adoption of computeraided design cad technologies then improved design productivity while the st century introduction of building information modeling bim processes has involved use of computergenerated models that can be used in their own right or to generate drawings and other visualisations as well as capturing nongeometric data about building components and systems
on some projects work on site will not start until design work is largely complete on others some design work may be undertaken concurrently with the early stages of onsite activity for example work on a buildings foundations may commence while designers are still working on the detailed designs of the buildings internal spaces
some projects may include elements that are designed for offsite construction see also prefabrication and modular building and are then delivered to site ready for erection installation or assembly
once contractors and other relevant professionals have been appointed and designs are sufficiently advanced work may commence on the project site
typically a construction site will include a secure perimeter to restrict unauthorised access site access control points office and welfare accommodation for personnel from the main contractor and other firms involved in the project team and storage areas for materials machinery and equipment
according to the mcgrawhill dictionary of architecture and constructions definition construction may be said to have started when the first feature of the permanent structure has been put in place such as pile driving or the pouring of slabs or footings
commissioning is the process of verifying that all subsystems of a new building or other asset work as intended to achieve the owners project requirements and as designed by the projects architects and engineers
maintenance involves functional checks servicing repairing or replacing of necessary devices equipment machinery building infrastructure and supporting utilities in industrial business governmental and residential installations
demolition is the discipline of safely and efficiently tearing down buildings and other artificial structures
demolition contrasts with deconstruction which involves taking a building apart while carefully preserving valuable elements for reuse purposes recycling see also circular economy
the output of the global construction industry was worth an estimated  trillion in  and in  was forecast to rise to  trillion by 
as a sector construction accounts for more than  of global gdp in developed countries construction comprises  of gdp and employs around  of the total employed workforce around the globe accounting for over  million full and parttime jobs in 
since  china has been the worlds largest single construction market
the united states is the second largest construction market with a  output of  trillion
in the united states in february  around  trillion worth of construction work was in progress according to the census bureau of which just over  trillion was for the private sector split roughly  between residential and nonresidential the remainder was public sector predominantly for state and local government
construction is a major source of employment in most countries high reliance on small businesses and underrepresentation of women are common traits
for example
according to mckinsey research productivity growth per worker in construction has lagged behind many other industries across different countries including in the united states and in european countries
in the united states construction productivity per worker has declined by half since the s
the twentyfive largest countries in the world by construction gva 
largescale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines
a project manager normally manages the budget on the job and a construction manager design engineer construction engineer or architect supervises it
those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements and legal issues environmental impact of the project scheduling budgeting and bidding construction site safety availability and transportation of building materials logistics and inconvenience to the public including those caused by construction delays
there are many routes to the different careers within the construction industry
there are three main tiers based on educational background and training which vary by country
unskilled and semiskilled workers provide general site labor often have few or no construction qualifications and may receive basic site training
skilled tradespeople have typically served apprenticeships sometimes in labor unions or received technical training this group also includes onsite managers who possess extensive knowledge and experience in their craft or profession
skilled manual occupations include carpenters electricians plumbers ironworkers heavy equipment operators and masons as well as those involved in project management
in the uk these require further education qualifications often in vocational subject areas undertaken either directly after completing compulsory education or through on the job apprenticeships
professional technical and managerial personnel often have higher education qualifications usually graduate degrees and are trained to design and manage construction processes
these roles require more training as they demand greater technical knowledge and involve more legal responsibility
example roles and qualification routes include
construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the united states and in the european union
in the us in or about  of worker fatalities in private industry occurred in construction
in  more than a third of us construction fatalities  out of  total fatalities were the result of falls
proper safety equipment such as harnesses hard hats and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry
other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution transportation accidents and trench caveins
other safety risks for workers in construction include hearing loss due to high noise exposure musculoskeletal injury chemical exposure and high levels of stress
besides that the high turnover of workers in construction industry imposes a huge challenge of accomplishing the restructuring of work practices in individual workplaces or with individual workers
citation needed construction has been identified by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh as a priority industry sector in the national occupational research agenda nora to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues
sustainability during the construction phase is an aspect of green building defined by the united states environmental protection agency epa as the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resourceefficient throughout a buildings lifecycle from siting to design construction operation maintenance renovation and deconstruction
a construction worker is a worker employed in manual labour of the physical construction of the built environment and its infrastructurethe term is a broad generic one and most such workers are primarily described by the specific level and type of work they perform
for example laborers carry out a wide range of practical tasks to help tradespersons on construction sites
they clean the construction site on a regular basis using tools such as rakes shovels and wheelbarrows to remove rubble scraps of metal and wood
they might also need to sweep out certain areas and put building supplies in order
construction workers may colloquially be referred to as hard hat workers or hard hats as they often wear hard hats for safety
construction safety is intended to ensure a safe environment for workers who are required to be educated on safety at each site
in a human rights watch report described unsafe and unfair working conditions in china and a failure on the part of the government to enforce labor standards in the construction industry
the international labour organization ilo estimated that at the end of   of the  million construction workers in china were migrant workers
many turned to work after their farming communities collapsed into povertyin the united states illegal immigrant labor is prevalent in the industry
due to workers questionable legal status some employers commit crimes such as wage theft and violation of workplace standards running little risk of consequences
similar abuse occurred in qatar during preparations for the  fifa world cup where workers mostly from poor countries in the indian subcontinent work in desert conditions for as little as  a day
allocation of costs is the transfer of costs from one cost item to one or more other cost items
allowance a value in an estimate to cover the cost of known but not yet fully defined work
assold estimate the estimate which matches the agreed items and price for the project scope
basis of estimate boe a document which describes the scope basis pricing basis methods qualifications assumptions inclusions and exclusions
bill of materials bom a list of materials required for the construction of a project or part of a project which may include quantities
bill of quantities boq a document used in tendering in the construction industry in which materials parts and labor and their costs are itemized
it also ideally details the terms and conditions of the construction or repair contract and itemises all work to enable a contractor to price the work for which he or she is bidding
bond usually refers to a performance bond which is a surety bond issued by an insurance company or a bank to guarantee satisfactory completion of a project by a contractor
other types of guarantees such as a bid bond or a materials bond are sometimes also required by a project owner
chart of accounts code of accounts coa a created list of the accounts used by a business entity to define each class of items for which money or the equivalent is spent or received
it is used to organize the finances of the entity and to segregate expenditures revenue assets and liabilities in order to give interested parties a better understanding of the financial health of the entity

home construction is the process of constructing a house generally referred to as a home when giving consideration to the people who might now or someday reside there
beginning with simple prehistoric shelters home construction techniques have evolved to produce the vast multitude of living accommodations available today
different levels of wealth and power have warranted various sizes luxuries and even defenses in a home
environmental considerations and cultural influences have created an immensely diverse collection of architectural styles
from castles to mud thatches mansions to shanties the home has grown to represent a seemingly limitless array of structures
the modern realty trade conventionally gives preference to home as a warmer term in reference to the house structure in the speculative context terminology reverts to house as a unit of built residential property as in the board game monopoly
note that a duplex is a housing structure which consists of two separate homes a duplex amounts to a single building construction project later marketed independently as two separate homes
the level of economic activity in the homeconstruction section is reported as housing starts though this is contrarily denominated in terms of distinct habitation units rather than distinct construction efforts
housing is also the chosen term in the related concepts of housing tenure affordable housing and housing unit aka dwelling
four of the primary trades involved in home construction are carpenters masons electricians and plumbers but there are many others as well
modern home construction is regarded as a form of residential construction
while homes may have originated in prehistory there are many notable stages through which cultures pass to reach the current level of modernization
countries and communities throughout the world currently exhibit very diverse concepts of housing at many different stages of home development
two methods for constructing a home can be distinguished the method in which architects simply assume free choice of materials and parts and the method in which reclaimed materials are used and the house is thus during its entire construction a work in progress meaning every single aspect of it is subject to change at any given time depending on what materials are found
the second method has been used throughout history as materials have always been scarce
civil site plans architectural drawings and specifications comprise the document set needed to construct a new home
specifications consist of a precise description of the materials to be used in construction
specifications are typically organized by each trade required to construct a home
the modern family home has many more systems and facets of construction than one might initially believe
with sufficient study an average person can understand everything there is to know about any given phase of home construction
the do it yourself diy boom of the late twentieth century was due in large part to this fact
and an international proliferation of kitset home and prefabricated home suppliers often consisting of components of chinese origin has further increased supply and made diy home building more prevalent
the process often starts with a planning stage in which plans are prepared by an architect and approved by the client and any regulatory authority
then the site is cleared foundations are laid and trenches for connection to services such as sewerage water and electricity are established
if the house is woodenframed a framework is constructed to support the boards siding and roof
if the house is of brick construction then courses of bricks are laid to construct the walls
floors beams and internal walls are constructed as the building develops with plumbing and wiring for water and electricity being installed as appropriate
once the main structure is complete internal fitting with lights and other fitments is done decorate home and furnished with furniture cupboards carpets curtains and other fittings
the cost of building a house varies by country widely
according to data from the national association of realtors the median cost of buying an existing singlefamily house in the united states is  whereas the average cost to build is 
several different factors can impact the cost of building a house including the size of the dwelling the and availability of resources the slope of the land the quality of the fixtures and fittings and the difficulty in finding construction and building materials talent
some of the typical expenses involved in a site cost can be connections to services such as water sewer electricity and gas fences retaining walls site clearance trees roots bushes site survey soil tests

according to data from the us census and bureau of labor statistics found the average floor area of a home in the united states has steadily increased over the past one hundred years with an estimated  square foot increase in the average floor area per year
in  the average floor area was  square feet  m which rose to  square feet  m by  and today sits at around  square feet  m
some have criticized the housebuilding industry
mass housebuilders can be risk averse preferring costefficient building methods rather than adopting new technologies for improved building performance
traditional vernacular building methods that suit local conditions and climates can be dispensed with in favour of a generic cookie cutter housing type
