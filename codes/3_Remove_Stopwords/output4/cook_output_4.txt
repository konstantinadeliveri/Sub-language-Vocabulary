salt serves main purposes preservation food charcuterie kitchen
inducing osmosis process involves movement water outside membranes cells reabsorb salted water cell
process assists destruction harmful pathogens
dehydration means salt pulls excess water protein aids shelf life protein moisture bacterial growth
fermentation third salt assists halting fermentation process otherwise completely break meat
