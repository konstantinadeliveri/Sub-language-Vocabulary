in cooking al dente italian pronunciation al dɛnte describes pasta or rice that is cooked to be firm to the bite
the etymology is italian to the toothin contemporary italian cooking the term identifies the ideal consistency for pasta and involves a brief cooking time
molto al dente is the culinary term for slightly undercooked pasta
undercooking pasta is used in the first round of cooking when a pasta dish is going to be cooked twice
according to the american diabetes association pasta that is cooked al dente has a lower glycemic index than pasta that is cooked soft
when cooking commercial pasta the al dente phase occurs right after the white of the pasta center disappears
al forno al forno literally to the oven meaning baked is food that has been baked in an oven
italian dishes commonly prepared in this way include pizza breads and pasta dishes notably lasagna
pasta is sometimes boiled before it is baked in al forno dishes
this double cooking means that it is served soft not with the firm al dente consistency that some italians prefer in pasta dishes
southern italy has a tradition of woodburning ovens and openflame grills
a woodfired oven and al forno dishes are a feature of many italian restaurants
brick and clay ovens are a key feature of cuisines of the mediterranean and middle east with wood being the main fuel for many parts of europe for many centuries
a typical oven found in italian restaurants is brick lined with an arched oven door and a wooden board with a very long handle is used to place the food to be cooked in the centre of the oven
baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat typically in an oven
but can also be done in hot ashes or on hot stones
the most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked
1 heat is gradually transferred from the surface of cakes cookies and breads to their center
as heat travels through it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center
2 baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously or one after the other
baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit
because of historical social and familial roles baking has traditionally been performed at home by women for daytoday meals and by men in bakeries and restaurants for local consumption
when production was industrialized baking was automated by machines in large factories
the art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for nutrition as baked goods especially breads are a common and important food both from an economic and cultural point of view
a person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a baker
on a related note a pastry chef is someone who is trained in the art of making pastries desserts bread and other baked goods
all types of food can be baked but some require special care and protection from direct heat
various techniques have been developed to provide this protection
in addition to bread baking is used to prepare cakes pastries pies tarts quiches cookies scones crackers pretzels and more
these popular items are known collectively as baked goods and are often sold at a bakery which is a store that carries only baked goods or at markets grocery stores farmers markets or through other venues
meat including cured meats such as ham can also be baked but baking is usually reserved for meatloaf smaller cuts of whole meats or whole meats that contain stuffing or coating such as bread crumbs or buttermilk batter
some foods are surrounded with moisture during baking by placing a small amount of liquid such as water or broth in the bottom of a closed pan and letting it steam up around the food
roasting is a term synonymous with baking but traditionally denotes the cooking of whole animals or major cuts through exposure to dry heat for instance one bakes chicken parts but roasts the whole bird
one can bake pork or lamb chops but roasts the whole loin or leg
there are many exceptions to this rule of the two terms
baking and roasting otherwise involve the same range of cooking times and temperatures
another form of baking is the method known as en croûte french for in a pastry crust which protects the food from direct heat and seals the natural juices inside
meat poultry game fish or vegetables can be prepared by baking en croûte
wellknown examples include beef wellington where the beef is encased in pastry before baking pâté en croûte where the terrine is encased in pastry before baking and the vietnamese variant a meatfilled pastry called pâté chaud
the en croûte method also allows meat to be baked by burying it in the embers of a fire a favorite method of cooking venison
salt can also be used to make a protective crust that is not eaten
another method of protecting food from the heat while it is baking is to cook it en papillote french for in parchment
in this method the food is covered by baking paper or aluminium foil to protect it while it is being baked
the cooked parcel of food is sometimes served unopened allowing diners to discover the contents for themselves which adds an element of surprise
eggs can also be used in baking to produce savoury or sweet dishes
in combination with dairy products especially cheese they are often prepared as a dessert
for example although a baked custard can be made using starch in the form of flour cornflour arrowroot or potato flour the flavor of the dish is much more delicate if eggs are used as the thickening agent
baked custards such as crème caramel are among the items that need protection from an ovens direct heat and the bainmarie method serves this purpose
the cooking container is half submerged in water in another larger one so that the heat in the oven is more gently applied during the baking process
baking a successful soufflé requires that the baking process be carefully controlled
the oven temperature must be absolutely even and the oven space not shared with another dish
these factors along with the theatrical effect of an airfilled dessert have given this baked food a reputation for being a culinary achievement
similarly a good baking technique and a good oven are also needed to create a baked alaska because of the difficulty of baking hot meringue and cold ice cream at the same time
baking can also be used to prepare other foods such as pizzas baked potatoes baked apples baked beans some casseroles and pasta dishes such as lasagne
the first evidence of baking occurred when humans took wild grass grains soaked them in water and mixed everything together mashing it into a kind of brothlike paste
3 the paste was cooked by pouring it onto a flat hot rock resulting in a breadlike substance
later when humans mastered fire the paste was roasted on hot embers which made breadmaking easier as it could now be made any time fire was created
the worlds oldest oven was discovered in croatia in 2014 dating back 6500 years ago
the ancient egyptians baked bread using yeast which they had previously been using to brew beer
4 bread baking began in ancient greece around 600 bc leading to the invention of enclosed ovens
4 ovens and worktables have been discovered in archaeological digs from turkey hacilar to palestine jericho tell essultan and date back to 5600 bc

baking flourished during the roman empire
beginning around 300 bc the pastry cook became an occupation for romans known as the pastillarium and became a respected profession because pastries were considered decadent and romans loved festivity and celebration
thus pastries were often cooked especially for large banquets and any pastry cook who could invent new types of tasty treats was highly prized
around 1 ad there were more than three hundred pastry chefs in rome and cato wrote about how they created all sorts of diverse foods and flourished professionally and socially because of their creations
cato speaks of an enormous number of breads including libum sacrificial cakes made with flour placenta groats and cress spira modern day flour pretzels scibilata tortes savaillum sweet cake and globus apherica fritters
a great selection of these with many different variations different ingredients and varied patterns were often found at banquets and dining halls
the romans baked bread in an oven with its own chimney and had mills to grind grain into flour
a bakers guild was established in 168 bc
in rome
4
eventually the roman art of baking became known throughout europe and eventually spread to eastern parts of asia
by the 13th century in london commercial trading including baking had many regulations attached
in the case of food they were designed to create a system so there was little possibility of false measures adulterated food or shoddy manufactures
there were by that time twenty regulations applying to bakers alone including that every baker had to have the impression of his seal upon bread
6
beginning in the 19th century alternative leavening agents became more common such as baking soda
4 bakers often baked goods at home and then sold them in the streets
this scene was so common that rembrandt among others painted a pastry chef selling pancakes in the streets of germany with children clamoring for a sample
in london pastry chefs sold their goods from handcarts
this developed into a delivery system of baked goods to households and greatly increased demand as a result
in paris the first openair café of baked goods was developed and baking became an established art throughout the entire world

in the united states the baking industry was built on marketing methods used during feudal times and production techniques developed by the romans
8 some makers of snacks such as potato chips or crisps have produced baked versions of their snack products as an alternative to the usual cooking method of deep frying in an attempt to reduce their calorie or fat content
baking has opened up doors to businesses such as cake shops and factories where the baking process is done with larger amounts in large open furnaces

the aroma and texture of baked goods as they come out of the oven are strongly appealing but is a quality that is quickly lost
since the flavour and appeal largely depend on freshness commercial producers have to compensate by using food additives as well as imaginative labeling
as more and more baked goods are purchased from commercial suppliers producers try to capture that original appeal by adding the label homebaked
such attempts seek to make an emotional link to the remembered freshness of baked goods as well as to attach positive associations the purchaser has with the idea of home to the bought product
freshness is such an important quality that restaurants although they are commercial and not domestic preparers of food bake their own products
for example scones at the ritz london hotel are not baked until early afternoon on the day they are to be served to make sure they are as fresh as possible
9
baking needs an enclosed space for heating typically in an oven
the fuel can be supplied by wood coal gas or electricity
adding and removing items from an oven may be done by hand with an oven mitt or by a peel a long handled tool specifically used for that purpose
many commercial ovens are equipped with two heating elements one for baking using convection and thermal conduction to heat the food and one for broiling or grilling heating mainly by radiation
another piece of equipment still used for baking is the dutch oven
also called a bake kettle bastable bread oven fire pan bake oven kail pot tin kitchen roasting kitchen doufeu french gentle fire or feu de compagne french country oven it originally replaced the cooking jack as the latest fireside cooking technology combining the convenience of potoven and hangover oven

asian cultures have adopted steam baskets to produce the effect of baking while reducing the amount of fat needed
11
eleven events occur concurrently during baking some of which such as starch gelatinization would not occur at room temperature
12
the dry heat of baking changes the form of starches in the food and causes its outer surfaces to brown giving it an attractive appearance and taste
the browning is caused by caramelization of sugars and the maillard reaction
maillard browning occurs when sugars break down in the presence of proteins
because foods contain many different types of sugars and proteins maillard browning contributes to the flavour of a wide range of foods including nuts roast beef and baked bread
14 the moisture is never entirely sealed in over time an item being baked will become dry
this is often an advantage especially in situations where drying is the desired outcome like drying herbs or roasting certain types of vegetables
the baking process does not require any fat to be used to cook in an oven
when baking consideration must be given to the amount of fat that is contained in the food item
higher levels of fat such as margarine butter lard or vegetable shortening will cause an item to spread out during the baking process
with the passage of time breads harden and become stale
this is not primarily due to moisture being lost from the baked products but more a reorganization of the way in which the water and starch are associated over time
this process is similar to recrystallization and is promoted by storage at cool temperatures such as in a domestic refrigerator or freezer
baking especially of bread holds special significance for many cultures
it is such a fundamental part of everyday food consumption that the childrens nursery rhyme patacake patacake bakers man takes baking as its subject
baked goods are normally served at all kinds of parties and special attention is given to their quality at formal events
they are also one of the main components of a tea party including at nursery teas and high teas a tradition which started in victorian britain reportedly when anna russell duchess of bedford grew tired of the sinking feeling which afflicted her every afternoon round 4 oclock
in 1840 she plucked up courage and asked for a tray of tea bread and butter and cake to be brought to her room
once she had formed the habit she found she could not break it so spread it among her friends instead
as the century progressed afternoon tea became increasingly elaborate

charcuterie listen sharkootəree also us listen ⁠ee french listen from chair meat and cuit cooked is a french term for a branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat products such as bacon ham sausage terrines galantines ballotines pâtés and confit primarily from porkcharcuterie is part of the garde manger chefs repertoire
originally intended as a way to preserve meat before the advent of refrigeration they are prepared today for their flavors derived from the preservation processes
the french word for a person who practices charcuterie is charcutier generally translated as pork butcher
this has led to the mistaken belief that charcuterie can only involve pork
the food lovers companion however says it refers to the products particularly but not limited to pork specialties such as pâtés rillettes galantines crépinettes etc which are made and sold in a delicatessenstyle shop also called a charcuterie
the 1961 edition of larousse gastronomique defines it as the art of preparing various meats in particular pork in order to present them in the most diverse ways
in the first century ad strabo recorded the import of salted meat from gaul and the romans may have been the first to regulate the trade of charcuterie as they wrote laws regulating the proper production of pork joints but the french have also had some influence
in 15thcentury france local guilds regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city
the guilds that produced charcuterie were those of the charcutiers
the members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried meats which varied sometimes distinctively from region to region
the only raw meat the charcutiers were allowed to sell was unrendered lard
the charcutier prepared numerous items including pâtés rillettes sausages bacon trotters and head cheese brawn
these preservation methods ensured the meats would have longer shelf lives
charcuterie became symbolic then to lower status peasantry
forcemeat is a mixture of ground lean meat emulsified with fat
the emulsification can be accomplished by grinding sieving or puréeing the ingredients
the emulsification may either be smooth or coarse in texture depending on the desired consistency of the final product
forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in charcuterie
meats commonly used in the production of forcemeats include pork fish pike trout or salmon seafood game meats venison boar or rabbit poultry game birds veal and pork livers
pork fatback is often used for the fat portion of forcemeat as it has a somewhat neutral flavorin us usage there are four basic styles of forcemeat
straight forcemeats are produced by progressively grinding equal parts pork and pork fat with a third dominant meat which can be pork or another meat
the proteins are cubed and then seasoned cured rested ground and then placed into desired vessel
countrystyle forcemeats are a combination of pork pork fat often with the addition of pork liver and garnish ingredients
the finished product has a coarse texture
the third style is gratin which has a portion of the main protein browned the french term gratin connotes a grated product that is browned
the final style is mousseline which are very light in texture using lean cuts of meat usually from veal poultry fish or shellfish
the resulting texture comes from the addition of eggs and cream to this forcemeat
the word sausage is derived through french from the latin sal salt as the sausagemaking technique involves placing ground or chopped meat along with salt into a tube
the tubes can vary but the more common animalderived tubes include sheep hog or cattle intestinal linings
additionally animal stomachs and bladders as well as edible artificial casings produced from collagen and inedible plant cellulose or paper are also used
inedible casings are primarily used to shape store and age the sausage
the two main variants of sausage are fresh and cooked
fresh sausages involve the production of raw meat placed into casings to be cooked at a later time whereas cooked sausages are heated during production and are ready to eat at the end of production
emulsified sausages are cooked sausages with a very fine texture using the combination of pork beef or poultry with fat salt cure flavorings and water
these ingredients are emulsified at high speed in a food processor or blender
during this process the salt dissolves the muscle proteins which helps to suspend the fat molecules
temperature is an important part of the process if the temperature rises above 60 16 for pork or 70 21 for beef the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process
pâté and terrines are often cooked in a pastry crust or an earthenware container
both the earthenware container and the dish itself are called a terrine
pâté and terrine are very similar the term pâté often suggests a finertextured forcemeat using liver whereas terrines are more often made of a coarser forcemeat
the meat is chopped or ground along with heavy seasoning which may include fat and aromatics
the seasoning is important as they will generally be served cold which mutes the flavorsthe mixture is placed into a lined mold covered and cooked in a water bath to control the temperature which will keep the forcemeat from separating as the water bath slows the heating process of the terrine
pâté and terrine are generally cooked to 160 71 while terrine made of foie gras are generally cooked to an internal temperature of 120 59
after the proper temperature is reached the terrine is removed from the oven and placed into a cooling unit topped with a weight to compact the contents of the terrine
it is then allowed to rest for several days to allow the flavors to blend
galantine is a chilled poultry product created after the french revolution by the chef to the marquis de brancas
the term galant connotes urbane sophistication
other origins are suggested the older french word for chicken géline or galine or the word gelatin
sources suggest the spelling of gelatin transformed into the words galentyne galyntyne galandyne and galendine
the galantine is prepared by skinning and boning a chicken or other poultry
the skin is laid flat with the pounded breast laid on top
a forcemeat is then placed on top of the pounded breast
the galantine is then rolled with the ends of the breast meeting one another
the galantine is then wrapped in cheesecloth and poached in poultry stock until the proper internal temperature is reachedroulade is similar to a galantine
the two major differences are instead of rolling the poultry evenly for the ends of the breasts to meet the bird is rolled into a pinwheel shape and the roulade is cooled by chilling it after it has been removed from the poaching liquid
salt serves four main purposes in the preservation of food in the charcuterie kitchen
the first is inducing osmosis this process involves the movement of water outside of the membranes of the cells which in turn reabsorb the salted water back into the cell
this process assists in the destruction of harmful pathogens
the second is dehydration which means the salt pulls excess water from the protein which aids in the shelf life of the protein as there is less moisture present for bacterial growth
fermentation is the third in which salt assists in halting the fermentation process which would otherwise completely break the meat down
finally salt assists in denaturing proteins which in essence means the structure of the proteins is effectively shifted similar to the effects of cookingbefore the discovery of nitrates and nitrites by german chemists around 1900 curing was done with unrefined salt and saltpeter
as saltpeter gives inconsistent results in preventing bacterial growth nitrate and nitrite in the forms of sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate have increased in popularity for their consistent results
nitrates take a considerably longer period of time to break down in cured foods than nitrites
because of this nitrates are the preferred curing salts for lengthy curing and drying periods
nitrites are often used in foods that require a shorter curing time and are used for any item that will be fully cooked
eventually a portion of the nitrates will be converted into nitrites by bacterial action
nitrite has multiple purposes in the curing process
one purpose is flavor the nitrites giving a sharp piquant flavor to the meat
second the nitrites react with substances in the meat to produce nitric oxide
nitric oxide prevents iron from breaking down the fat in the meat thus halting rancidity
the binding also creates the characteristic reddish color found in most cured meat
finally the nitrite inhibits the growth of botulismcausing organisms that would ordinarily thrive in the oxygendeprived environment in the sausage casing
german scientists originally named botulism poisoning wurstvergiftung sausage poisoning
the term botulism derives its name from the latin term for sausageeating cured and processed meat products has been linked to a small increase in gastric cancer as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and colorectal cancer
the negative effects are presumed to be caused by nitrates and nitrites as well as nitrosamines which are formed by nitrites reacting with meat
these risks are generally regarded as minimal and regulations in the united states limit ingoing nitrites to 156 parts per million 00156 less for bacon as a precautionary measure
two main types of curing salt mixture are used by the charcutier
the first is known by multiple names including tinted cure mix pink cure prague powder or instacure 1
the mixture is 9375 sodium chloride and 625 sodium nitrite
when used the recommended amount is a ratio of 4 oz for each 100 lb 1 kg for each 400 kg of meat or 025 of the total weight of the meat
this blend is colored bright pink to keep the charcutier from confusing the mixture with regular saltthe second curing salt blend is called prague powder ii or instacure 2
also colored pink to differentiate it from table salt it contains 625 sodium nitrite 4 sodium nitrate and 8975 table salt
this mixture is used for dry sausages that require a longer drying period which requires the presence of nitrate
sweeteners and other flavoring agents are necessary in the production of many cured products due to the harsh flavors of the salt
a number of sweeteners can be used in curing foods including dextrose sugar corn syrup honey and maple syrup
dextrose is seen often in cured meat as it not only mellows the harshness but it also increases the moisture content of the cured product while adding less sweetness to the cured meat
the sweeteners also assist in stabilizing the colors in meat and help the fermentation process by giving a nutrient to the bacterianumerous spices and herbs are used in the curing process to assist with the flavor of the final product
the sweet spices regularly used include cinnamon allspice nutmeg mace and cardamom
other flavoring agents may include dried and fresh chilies wine fruit juice or vinegar
fermented sausages are created by salting chopped or ground meat to remove moisture while allowing beneficial bacteria to break down sugars into flavorful molecules
bacteria including lactobacillus species and leuconostoc species break down these sugars to produce lactic acid which not only affects the flavor of the sausage but also lowers the ph from 60 to 4550 preventing the growth of bacteria that could spoil the sausage
these effects are magnified during the drying process as the salt and acidity are concentrated as moisture is extracted

a commis is a basic chef in larger kitchens who works under a chef de partie to learn the stations or ranges responsibilities and operation
this may be a chef who has recently completed formal culinary training or is still undergoing training
stationchef titles which are part of the brigade system include
kitchen assistants are of two types kitchenhands and stewards kitchen porters
kitchenhands assist with basic food preparation tasks under the chefs direction
they carry out relatively unskilled tasks such as peeling potatoes and washing salad
stewards kitchen porters are involved in the scullery washing up and general cleaning duties
in a smaller kitchen these duties may be incorporated
a communard is in charge of preparing the meal for the staff during a shift
this meal is often referred to as the staff or family mealthe escuelerie from 15th century french and a cognate of the english scullery or the more modern plongeur or dishwasher is the keeper of dishes having charge of dishes and keeping the kitchen clean
a common humorous title for this role in some modern kitchens is chef de plonge or head dishwasher
education is available from many culinary institutions offering diploma associate and bachelors degree programs in culinary arts
depending on the level of education this can take one to four years
an internship is often part of the curriculum
regardless of the education received most professional kitchens follow the apprenticeship system and most new cooks will start at a lowerlevel 2nd or 1st cook position and work their way up
like many skilled trades chefs usually go through a formal apprenticeship which includes many years of onthejob training
culinary schools and restaurants offer these apprenticeships
to become an apprentice one must be at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma or ged
apprenticeships usually take 3 to 4 years to complete and combine classroom instruction with onthejob training
the training period for a chef is generally four years as an apprentice
a newly qualified chef is advanced or more commonly a toquecommischef consisting of firstyear commis secondyear commis and so on
the rate of pay is usually in accordance with the chefs
like all other chefs except the executivechef trainees are placed in sections of the kitchen eg the starter appetizer or entrée sections under the guidance of a demichef de partie and are given relatively basic tasks
ideally over time a commis will spend a certain period in each section of the kitchen to learn the basics
unaided a commis may work on the vegetable station of a kitchenthe usual formal training period for a chef is two to four years in catering college
they often spend the summer in work placements
in some cases this is modified to dayrelease courses a chef will work fulltime in a kitchen as an apprentice and then would have allocated days off to attend catering college
these courses can last between one and three years
in the uk most chefs are trained in the work place with most doing a formal nvq level 2 or 3 in the work place
the standard uniform for a chef includes a hat called a toque necktie doublebreasted jacket apron and shoes with steel or plastic toecaps
a chefs hat was originally designed as a tall rippled hat called a dodin bouffant or more commonly a toque
neckties were originally worn to allow for the mopping of sweat from the face but as this is now against health regulations they are largely decorative
the chefs neck tie was originally worn on the inside of the jacket to stop sweat running from the face and neck down the body
the jacket is usually white to show off the chefs cleanliness and repel heat and is doublebreasted to prevent serious injuries from burns and scalds
the double breast also serves to conceal stains on the jacket as one side can be rebuttoned over the other which is common practice
an apron is worn to just below kneelength also to assist in the prevention of burns because of spillage
if hot liquid is spilled onto it the apron can be quickly removed to minimize burns and scalds
shoes and clogs are hardwearing and with a steeltop cap to prevent injury from falling objects or knives
according to some hygiene regulations jewelry is not allowed apart from wedding bands and religious jewelry
if wound dressings are required they should be blue—an unusual colour for foodstuffs—so that they are noticeable if they fall into food
facial hair and longer hair are often required to be netted or trimmed for food safety
bandages on the hands are usually covered with nylon gloves
latex is not typically used for food preparation due to latex allergy

kitchen assistants are of two types kitchenhands and stewards kitchen porters
kitchenhands assist with basic food preparation tasks under the chefs direction
they carry out relatively unskilled tasks such as peeling potatoes and washing salad
stewards kitchen porters are involved in the scullery washing up and general cleaning duties
in a smaller kitchen these duties may be incorporated
a communard is in charge of preparing the meal for the staff during a shift
this meal is often referred to as the staff or family meal
6
the escuelerie from 15th century french and a cognate of the english scullery or the more modern plongeur or dishwasher is the keeper of dishes having charge of dishes and keeping the kitchen clean
a common humorous title for this role in some modern kitchens is chef de plonge or head dishwasher
8
education is available from many culinary institutions offering diploma associate and bachelors degree programs in culinary arts
depending on the level of education this can take one to four years
an internship is often part of the curriculum
regardless of the education received most professional kitchens follow the apprenticeship system and most new cooks will start at a lowerlevel 2nd or 1st cook position and work their way up
like many skilled trades chefs usually go through a formal apprenticeship which includes many years of onthejob training
culinary schools and restaurants offer these apprenticeships
to become an apprentice one must be at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma or ged
apprenticeships usually take 3 to 4 years to complete and combine classroom instruction with onthejob training
the training period for a chef is generally four years as an apprentice
a newly qualified chef is advanced or more commonly a toquecommischef consisting of firstyear commis secondyear commis and so on
the rate of pay is usually in accordance with the chefs
like all other chefs except the executivechef trainees are placed in sections of the kitchen eg the starter appetizer or entrée sections under the guidance of a demichef de partie and are given relatively basic tasks
ideally over time a commis will spend a certain period in each section of the kitchen to learn the basics
unaided a commis may work on the vegetable station of a kitchen
9
the usual formal training period for a chef is two to four years in catering college
they often spend the summer in work placements
in some cases this is modified to dayrelease courses a chef will work fulltime in a kitchen as an apprentice and then would have allocated days off to attend catering college
these courses can last between one and three years
in the uk most chefs are trained in the work place with most doing a formal nvq level 2 or 3 in the work place
the standard uniform for a chef includes a hat called a toque necktie doublebreasted jacket apron and shoes with steel or plastic toecaps
a chefs hat was originally designed as a tall rippled hat called a dodin bouffant or more commonly a toque
neckties were originally worn to allow for the mopping of sweat from the face but as this is now against health regulations they are largely decorative
the chefs neck tie was originally worn on the inside of the jacket to stop sweat running from the face and neck down the body
10 the jacket is usually white to show off the chefs cleanliness and repel heat and is doublebreasted to prevent serious injuries from burns and scalds
the double breast also serves to conceal stains on the jacket as one side can be rebuttoned over the other which is common practice
an apron is worn to just below kneelength also to assist in the prevention of burns because of spillage
if hot liquid is spilled onto it the apron can be quickly removed to minimize burns and scalds
shoes and clogs are hardwearing and with a steeltop cap to prevent injury from falling objects or knives
according to some hygiene regulations jewelry is not allowed apart from wedding bands and religious jewelry
if wound dressings are required they should be blue—an unusual colour for foodstuffs—so that they are noticeable if they fall into food
facial hair and longer hair are often required to be netted or trimmed for food safety
citation needed bandages on the hands are usually covered with nylon gloves
latex is not typically used for food preparation due to latex allergy
chocolate is a preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is made in the form of a liquid paste or in a block which may also be used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods
the earliest signs of use are associated with olmec sites within what would become mexico s postcolonial territory suggesting consumption of chocolate beverages dating from the 19th century bc
the majority of mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages including the maya and aztecs
the english word chocolate comes via spanish from the classical nahuatl word xocolātlthe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor
after fermentation the beans are dried cleaned and roasted
the shell is removed to produce cacao nibs which are then ground to cocoa mass unadulterated chocolate in rough form
once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating it is called chocolate liquor
the liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components cocoa solids and cocoa butter
baking chocolate also called bitter chocolate contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions without any added sugar
powdered baking cocoa which contains more fiber than cocoa butter can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa
much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate a combination of cocoa solids cocoa butter or added vegetable oils and sugar
milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk
white chocolate contains cocoa butter sugar and milk but no cocoa solids
chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist particularly desserts including cakes pudding mousse chocolate brownies and chocolate chip cookies
many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate
chocolate bars either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate are eaten as snacks
gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes such as eggs hearts coins are traditional on certain western holidays including christmas easter valentines day and hanukkah
chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate and in some alcoholic drinks such as creme de cacao
although cocoa originated in the americas west african countries particularly côte divoire and ghana are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century accounting for some 60 of the world cocoa supply
with some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in west africa child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018 international attempts to improve conditions for children were failing because of persistent poverty absence of schools increasing world cocoa demand more intensive farming of cocoa and continued exploitation of child labor
chocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history
for example one vessel found at an olmec archaeological site on the gulf coast of veracruz mexico dates chocolates preparation by preolmec peoples as early as 1750 bc
on the pacific coast of chiapas mexico a mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cacao beverages dating even earlier to 1900 bc
the residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cacao was not simply as a beverage but the white pulp around the cacao beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink
an early classicperiod 460480 ad mayan tomb from the site in rio azul had vessels with the maya glyph for cacao on them with residue of a chocolate drink suggests the maya were drinking chocolate around 400 ad
documents in maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes in addition to everyday life
the maya grew cacao trees in their backyards and used the cacao seeds the trees produced to make a frothy bitter drinkby the 15th century the aztecs gained control of a large part of mesoamerica and adopted cacao into their culture
they associated chocolate with quetzalcoatl who according to one legend was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice
in contrast to the maya who liked their chocolate warm the aztecs drank it cold seasoning it with a broad variety of additives including the petals of the cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree chile pepper allspice vanilla and honey
the aztecs were unable to grow cacao themselves as their home in the mexican highlands was unsuitable for it so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire
those who lived in areas ruled by the aztecs were required to offer cacao seeds in payment of the tax they deemed tribute
cocoa beans were often used as currency
for example the aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cacao beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beansthe maya and aztecs associated cacao with human sacrifice and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood
the spanish royal chronicler gonzalo fernández de oviedo y valdés described a chocolate drink he had seen in nicaragua in 1528 mixed with achiote because those people are fond of drinking human blood to make this beverage seem like blood they add a little achiote so that it then turns red
and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth and when it is red for having achiote it seems a horrific thing because it seems like blood itself
until the 16th century no european had ever heard of the popular drink from the central american peoples
christopher columbus and his son ferdinand encountered the cacao bean on columbuss fourth mission to the americas on 15 august 1502 when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cacao beans among other goods for trade
spanish conquistador hernán cortés may have been the first european to encounter it as the frothy drink was part of the afterdinner routine of montezuma
josé de acosta a spanish jesuit missionary who lived in peru and then mexico in the later 16th century wrote of its growing influence on the spaniards
loathsome to such as are not acquainted with it having a scum or froth that is very unpleasant to taste
yet it is a drink very much esteemed among the indians wherewith they feast noble men who pass through their country
the spaniards both men and women that are accustomed to the country are very greedy of this chocolaté
they say they make diverse sorts of it some hot some cold and some temperate and put therein much of that chili yea they make paste thereof the which they say is good for the stomach and against the catarrh
while columbus had taken cacao beans with him back to spain chocolate made no impact until spanish friars introduced it to the spanish court
after the spanish conquest of the aztecs chocolate was imported to europe
there it quickly became a court favorite
it was still served as a beverage but the spanish added sugar as well as honey the original sweetener used by the aztecs for chocolate to counteract the natural bitterness
vanilla another indigenous american introduction was also a popular additive with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor
unfortunately these spices tended to unsettle the european constitution the encyclopédie states the pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset ones stomach which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as healthy chocolate
by 1602 chocolate had made its way from spain to austria
by 1662 pope alexander vii had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks
within about a hundred years chocolate established a foothold throughout europe
the new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market as between the early 1600s and late 1800s the laborious and slow processing of the cacao bean was manual
cacao plantations spread as the english dutch and french colonized and planted
with the depletion of mesoamerican workers largely to disease cacao production was often the work of poor wage laborers and african slaves
windpowered and horsedrawn mills were used to speed production augmenting human labor
heating the working areas of the tablemill an innovation that emerged in france in 1732 also assisted in extractionnew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the industrial revolution
in 1815 dutch chemist coenraad van houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate which reduced its bitterness
a few years thereafter in 1828 he created a press to remove about half the natural fat cocoa butter or cacao butter from chocolate liquor which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality
this innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate
known as dutch cocoa this machinepressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when in 1847 english chocolatier joseph fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter
subsequently his chocolate factory frys of bristol england began massproducing chocolate bars frys chocolate cream launched in 1866 and they became very popular
milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid17th century but in 1875 swiss chocolatier daniel peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by henri nestlé with the liquor
in 1879 the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when rudolphe lindt invented the conching machinebesides nestlé several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries
rowntrees of york set up and began producing chocolate in 1862 after buying out the tuke family business
cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in england by 1868
manufacturing their first easter egg in 1875 cadbury created the modern chocolate easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes
in 1893 milton s hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the worlds columbian exposition in chicago and soon began the career of hersheys chocolates with chocolatecoated caramels
the baker chocolate company which makes bakers chocolate is the oldest producer of chocolate in the united states
in 1765 dr james baker and john hannon founded the company in boston
using cocoa beans from the west indies the pair built their chocolate business which is still in operationwhite chocolate was first introduced to the us in 1946 by frederick e hebert of hebert candies in shrewsbury massachusetts near boston after he had tasted white coat candies while traveling in europe
cacao pronounced by the olmecs as kakawa dates to 1000 bc or earlier
the word chocolate entered the english language from spanish in about 1600
the word entered spanish from the word xocolātl in nahuatl the language of the aztecs
the origin of the nahuatl word is uncertain as it does not appear in any early nahuatl source where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl cacao water
it is possible that the spaniards coined the word perhaps in order to avoid caca a vulgar spanish word for faeces by combining the yucatec mayan word chocol hot with the nahuatl word atl water
another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl meaning beaten drink which may derive from the word for the frothing stick chicoli
the term chocolatier for a chocolate confection maker is attested from 1888
several types of chocolate can be distinguished
pure unsweetened chocolate often called baking chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions
much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate which combines chocolate with sugar
milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk
in the uk and ireland milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20 total dry cocoa solids in the rest of the european union the minimum is 25
white chocolate although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color
in 2002 the us food and drug administration established a standard for white chocolate as the common or usual name of products made from cacao fat ie cocoa butter milk solids nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners and other safe and suitable ingredients but containing no nonfat cacao solids
dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture
the us food and drug administration calls this sweet chocolate and requires a 15 concentration of chocolate liquor
european rules specify a minimum of 35 cocoa solids
a higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness
semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content
bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar typically a third more cocoa butter and vanilla are added
it has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate but the two are interchangeable in baking
it is also known to last for two years if stored properly
as of 2017 there is no highquality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits
unsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor also known as bitter or baking chocolate
it is unadulterated chocolate the pure ground roasted chocolate beans impart a strong deep chocolate flavor
it is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added
raw chocolate often referred to as raw cacao is always dark and a minimum of 75 cacao
poorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part called chocolate bloom it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage
it is not toxic and can be safely consumed
roughly twothirds of the entire worlds cocoa is produced in west africa with 43 sourced from côte divoire where as of 2007 child labor is a common practice to obtain the product
according to the world cocoa foundation in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood
as of 2007 in the uk most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them to melt mold and package to their own design
according to the wcfs 2012 report the ivory coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world
the two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers
chocolate makers use harvested cacao beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate covering
chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies bars truffles etc
production costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat
cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called chocolate due to the risk of lower demand for their crops
the sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved
due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cacao is grown 20 degrees north and south of the equator the commercial company mars incorporated and the university of california berkeley are conducting genomic research in 201718 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates
chocolate is made from cocoa beans the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree theobroma cacao a small 48 m tall 1526 ft tall evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the americas
recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout south and central america
early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now venezuela
the scientific name theobroma means food of the gods
the fruit called a cacao pod is ovoid 1530 cm 612 in long and 810 cm 34 in wide ripening yellow to orange and weighing about 500 g 11 lb when ripe
cacao trees are small understory trees that need rich welldrained soils
they naturally grow within 20 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 70 to 90
cacao trees can not tolerate a temperature lower than 15 59 f the three main varieties of cacao beans used in chocolate are criollo forastero and trinitario
representing only 5 of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market and is native to central america the caribbean islands and the northern tier of south american states
the genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties
criollos are particularly difficult to grow as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree
the flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex low in classic chocolate flavor but rich in secondary notes of long duration
the most commonly grown bean is forastero a large group of wild and cultivated cacaos most likely native to the amazon basin
the african cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero
they are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo
the source of most chocolate marketed forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic chocolate flavor but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors producing quite bland chocolate
trinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero
trinitario originated in trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop
nearly all cacao produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lowergrade trinitario varieties
cacao pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete or by knocking them off the tree using a stick
the beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins allowing access to microorganisms so fermentation of the pectincontaining material can begin
yeasts produce ethanol lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid
the fermentation process which takes up to seven days also produces several flavor precursors eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate tasteit is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe because if the pod is unripe the beans will have a low cocoa butter content or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation resulting in a weak flavor
after fermentation the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth
climate and weather permitting this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven daysthe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility
the beans are cleaned removing twigs stones and other debris roasted and graded
next the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib
finally the nibs are ground and liquefied resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form chocolate liquor
the liquor can be further processed into two components cocoa solids and cocoa butter
chocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture
the basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first are
dark chocolate sugar cocoa butter cocoa liquor and sometimes vanilla
milk chocolate sugar cocoa butter cocoa liquor milk or milk powder and vanilla
white chocolate sugar cocoa butter milk or milk powder and vanillausually an emulsifying agent such as soy lecithin is added though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain gmofree sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture
some manufacturers are now using pgpr an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel
the texture is also heavily influenced by processing specifically conching see below
the more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added
different manufacturers develop their own signature blends based on the above formulas but varying proportions of the different constituents are used
the finest plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70 cocoa both solids and butter whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50
highquality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35 cocoa butter
producers of highquality smallbatch chocolate argue that mass production produces badquality chocolate
some massproduced chocolate contains much less cocoa as low as 7 in many cases and fats other than cocoa butter
vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented andor roasted beansin 2007 the chocolate manufacturers association in the united states whose members include hershey nestlé and archer daniels midland lobbied the food and drug administration fda to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes
currently the fda does not allow a product to be referred to as chocolate if the product contains any of these ingredientsin the eu a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5 vegetable oil and must be labeled as family milk chocolate rather than milk chocolate if it contains 20 milkaccording to canadian food and drug regulations a chocolate product is a food product that is sourced from at least one cocoa product and contains at least one of the following chocolate bittersweet chocolate semisweet chocolate dark chocolate sweet chocolate milk chocolate or white chocolate
a cocoa product is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains cocoa nibs cocoa liquor cocoa mass unsweetened chocolate bitter chocolate chocolate liquor cocoa lowfat cocoa cocoa powder or lowfat cocoa powder
the penultimate process is called conching
a conche is a container filled with metal beads which act as grinders
the refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat
chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture
the conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect hence the smooth feel in the mouth
the length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate
highquality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours and lesser grades about four to six hours
after the process is complete the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 113 to 122 until final processing
the final process is called tempering
uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye
this causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken
the uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process
the fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms polymorphous crystallization
the primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present
the six different crystal forms have different properties
as a solid piece of chocolate the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance
once heated the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases the melting process
when the heat is removed the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together allowing the chocolate to solidifythe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat
chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperaturemaking chocolate considered good is about forming as many type v crystals as possible
this provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time
to accomplish this the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization
generally the chocolate is first heated to 45 113 to melt all six forms of crystals
next the chocolate is cooled to about 27 81 which will allow crystal types iv and v to form
at this temperature the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal seeds which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate
the chocolate is then heated to about 31 88 to eliminate any type iv crystals leaving just type v after this point any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated
other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well
the most common variant is introducing already tempered solid seed chocolate
the temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency
a sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results
two classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are
working the molten chocolate on a heatabsorbing surface such as a stone slab until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal seeds the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature
stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to inoculate the liquid chocolate with crystals this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to seed the molten chocolatechocolate tempering machines or temperers with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate
in particular continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications
various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by aasted sollich and buhler three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment with a focus now on energy efficiency
in general molten chocolate coming in at 4050 is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 2630 passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear then warmed slightly to remelt undesirable crystal formations
chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity
ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 59 and 63 with a relative humidity of less than 50
if refrigerated or frozen without containment chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface
various types of blooming effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperlychocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 75 while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 59 or excess humidity
to distinguish between different types of bloom one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly and if the bloom disappears it is fat bloom
moving chocolate between temperature extremes can result in an oily texture
although visually unappealing chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected
bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolatechocolate is generally stored away from other foods as it can absorb different aromas
ideally chocolates are packed or wrapped and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature
additionally chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper
the glossy shine snap aroma texture and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well
a 100gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories
it is 59 carbohydrates 52 as sugar and 3 as dietary fiber 30 fat and 8 protein table
approximately 65 of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid table
100grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source over 19 of the daily value dv of riboflavin vitamin b12 and the dietary minerals manganese phosphorus and zinc
chocolate is a good source 1019 dv of calcium magnesium and iron
chocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents theobromine may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus
theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans
however daily intake of 50100 g cocoa 0815 g theobromine by humans has been associated with sweating trembling and severe headache
chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine which have physiological effects in humans but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals including dogs and catsaccording to a 2005 study the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is 05 ngg which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food
however during cultivation and production chocolate may absorb lead from the environment such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline which is still being used in nigeria
reports from 2014 indicate that chocolate might be a significant source of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high with dark chocolate containing higher amounts and one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20 of the daily lead oral limit
chocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate which may increase the risk of kidney stonesa few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children
other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it
research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure
chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases or cognitive abilitiesone tablespoonful 5 grams of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 121 mg of caffeine and a 25g single serving of dark chocolate has 224 mg of caffeine
although a single 7 oz
serving of coffee may contain 80175 mg studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg and a dose as low as 125 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performanceexcessive consumption of large quantities of any energyrich food such as chocolate without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity
raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process
manufacturers may add other fats sugars and milk all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate
in comparison to most foods cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants
cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids and alkaloids such as theobromine phenethylamine and caffeine
some manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of cocoa or cacao
this refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar not just the percentage of cocoa solids
the belgian ambao certification mark indicates that no noncocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate
a longstanding dispute between britain on the one hand and belgium and france over british use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products
this british style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as vegelatechocolates that are organic or fair trade certified carry labels accordingly
in the united states some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as chocolate
in june 2007 in response to consumer concern about the proposal the fda reiterated cacao fat as one of the signature characteristics of the product will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate
chocolate prevalent throughout the world is a steadily growing us50 billionayear worldwide business
europe accounts for 45 of the worlds chocolate revenue and the us spent 20 billion in 2013
big chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in europe and the us us companies mars and hersheys alone generated 13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for twothirds of us production in 2004
despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally cocoa farmers and labourers in the ivory coast are unaware of the uses of the beans the high cost of chocolate products in the ivory coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population who do not know what it tastes like
chocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge
large manufacturers of chocolate products include cadbury the worlds largest confectionery manufacturer ferrero guylian the hershey company lindt sprüngli mars incorporated milka neuhaus and suchard
guylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells cadbury for its dairy milk and creme egg
the hershey company the largest chocolate manufacturer in north america produces the hershey bar and hersheys kisses
mars incorporated a large privately owned us corporation produces mars bar milky way mms twix and snickers
lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foilwrapped easter bunnies
food conglomerates nestlé sa and kraft foods both have chocolate brands
nestlé acquired rowntrees in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand including smarties a chocolate candy and kit kat a chocolate bar kraft foods through its 1990 acquisition of jacobs suchard now owns milka and suchard
in february 2010 kraft also acquired britishbased cadbury frys trebor basset and the fair trade brand green blacks also belongs to the group
the widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation but also because up to 12000 of the 200000 children working in côte divoire the worlds biggest producer of cocoa may be victims of trafficking or slavery
most attention on this subject has focused on west africa which collectively supplies 69 percent of the worlds cocoa and côte divoire in particular which supplies 35 percent of the worlds cocoa
thirty percent of children under age 15 in subsaharan africa are child laborers mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming
major chocolate producers such as nestlé buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoain 2009 salvation army international development said uk stated that 12000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the ivory coast of africa where half of the worlds chocolate is made
said uk states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in harsh and abusive conditions for the production of chocolate and an increasing number of healthfood and antislavery organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry
as of 2017 approximately 21 million children in ghana and côte divoire were involved in farming cocoa carrying heavy loads clearing forests and being exposed to pesticides
according to sona ebai the former secretarygeneral of the alliance of cocoa producing countries i think child labor can not be just the responsibility of industry to solve
i think its the proverbial allhandsondeck government civil society the private sector
and there you need leadership
reported in 2018 a 3year pilot program conducted by nestlé with 26000 farmers mostly located in côte divoire observed a 51 decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming
the us department of labor formed the child labor cocoa coordinating group as a publicprivate partnership with the governments of ghana and côte divoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry
the international cocoa initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the child labor monitoring and remediation system intended to monitor thousands of farms in ghana and côte divoire for child labor conditions but the program reached less than 20 of the child laborers
despite these efforts goals to reduce child labor in west africa by 70 before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty absence of schools expansion of cocoa farmland and increased demand for cocoain april 2018 the cocoa barometer report stated not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sectorwide objective of the elimination of child labor and not even near their commitments of a 70 reduction of child labor by 2020
in the 2000s some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries
traditionally africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa which caused poverty to abound
fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system
one solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an agricultural cooperative
cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food clothes and school fees
one of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers
the effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned
in a 2014 article the economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system
chocolate is sold in chocolate bars which come in dark chocolate milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties
some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate such as nuts raisins or crisped rice
chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars which typically contain various confectionary ingredients eg nougat wafers caramel nuts etc
which are coated in chocolate
chocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts such as chocolate cakes chocolate brownies chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies
numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate either as a filling eg mms or as a coating eg chocolatecoated raisins or chocolatecoated peanuts
some nonalcoholic beverages contain chocolate such as chocolate milk hot chocolate and chocolate milkshakes
some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao
chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes
the caffè mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate
cooking or cookery is the art science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption
cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves to baking in various types of ovens reflecting unique environmental economic and cultural traditions and trends
types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of cooks
cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments
cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat such as in ceviche a traditional south american dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice or orange juice
preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans
it may have started around 2 million years ago though archaeological evidence for it reaches no more than 1 million years ago
1
the expansion of agriculture commerce trade and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients
new inventions and technologies such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling water expanded cooking techniques
some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served
2
phylogenetic analysis suggests that human ancestors may have invented cooking as far back as 18 million to 23 million years ago
3 reanalysis of burnt bone fragments and plant ashes from the wonderwerk cave in south africa has provided evidence supporting control of fire by early humans by 1 million years ago
4 there is evidence that homo erectus were cooking their food as early as 500000 years ago
5 evidence for the controlled use of fire by homo erectus beginning some 400000 years ago has wide scholarly support
67 archaeological evidence from 300000 years ago8 in the form of ancient hearths earth ovens burnt animal bones and flint are found across europe and the middle east
anthropologists think that widespread cooking fires began about 250000 years ago when hearths first appeared
9
recently the earliest hearths have been reported to be at least 790000 years old
10
communication between the old world and the new world in the columbian exchange influenced the history of cooking
the movement of foods across the atlantic from the new world such as potatoes tomatoes maize beans bell pepper chili pepper vanilla pumpkin cassava avocado peanut pecan cashew pineapple blueberry sunflower chocolate gourds and squash had a profound effect on old world cooking
the movement of foods across the atlantic from the old world such as cattle sheep pigs wheat oats barley rice apples pears peas chickpeas green beans mustard and carrots similarly changed new world cooking
11
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries food was a classic marker of identity in europe
in the nineteenthcentury age of nationalism cuisine became a defining symbol of national identity
the industrial revolution brought massproduction massmarketing and standardization of food
factories processed preserved canned and packaged a wide variety of foods and processed cereals quickly became a defining feature of the american breakfast
12 in the 1920s freezing methods cafeterias and fast food restaurants emerged
most ingredients in cooking are derived from living organisms
vegetables fruits grains and nuts as well as herbs and spices come from plants while meat eggs and dairy products come from animals
mushrooms and the yeast used in baking are kinds of fungi
cooks also use water and minerals such as salt
cooks can also use wine or spirits
naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called proteins carbohydrates and fats
they also contain water and minerals
cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of these molecules
carbohydrates include the common sugar sucrose table sugar a disaccharide and such simple sugars as glucose made by enzymatic splitting of sucrose and fructose from fruit and starches from sources such as cereal flour rice arrowroot and potato
13
the interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex
longchain sugars such as starch tend to break down into simpler sugars when cooked while simple sugars can form syrups
if sugars are heated so that all water of crystallisation is driven off then caramelization starts with the sugar undergoing thermal decomposition with the formation of carbon and other breakdown products producing caramel
similarly the heating of sugars and proteins elicits the maillard reaction a basic flavorenhancing technique
an emulsion of starch with fat or water can when gently heated provide thickening to the dish being cooked
in european cooking a mixture of butter and flour called a roux is used to thicken liquids to make stews or sauces
14 in asian cooking a similar effect is obtained from a mixture of rice or corn starch and water
these techniques rely on the properties of starches to create simpler mucilaginous saccharides during cooking which causes the familiar thickening of sauces
this thickening will break down however under additional heat
types of fat include vegetable oils animal products such as butter and lard as well as fats from grains including maize and flax oils
fats are used in a number of ways in cooking and baking
to prepare stir fries grilled cheese or pancakes the pan or griddle is often coated with fat or oil
fats are also used as an ingredient in baked goods such as cookies cakes and pies
fats can reach temperatures higher than the boiling point of water and are often used to conduct high heat to other ingredients such as in frying deep frying or sautéing
fats are used to add flavor to food eg butter or bacon fat prevent food from sticking to pans and create a desirable texture
edible animal material including muscle offal milk eggs and egg whites contains substantial amounts of protein
almost all vegetable matter in particular legumes and seeds also includes proteins although generally in smaller amounts
mushrooms have high protein content
any of these may be sources of essential amino acids
when proteins are heated they become denatured unfolded and change texture
in many cases this causes the structure of the material to become softer or more friable meat becomes cooked and is more friable and less flexible
in some cases proteins can form more rigid structures such as the coagulation of albumen in egg whites
the formation of a relatively rigid but flexible matrix from egg white provides an important component in baking cakes and also underpins many desserts based on meringue
cooking often involves water and waterbased liquids
these can be added in order to immerse the substances being cooked this is typically done with water stock or wine
alternatively the foods themselves can release water
a favorite method of adding flavor to dishes is to save the liquid for use in other recipes
liquids are so important to cooking that the name of the cooking method used is often based on how the liquid is combined with the food as in steaming simmering boiling braising and blanching
heating liquid in an open container results in rapidly increased evaporation which concentrates the remaining flavor and ingredients this is a critical component of both stewing and sauce making
vitamins and minerals are required for normal metabolism but which the body can not manufacture itself and which must therefore come from external sources
vitamins come from several sources including fresh fruit and vegetables vitamin c carrots liver vitamin a cereal bran bread liver b vitamins fish liver oil vitamin d and fresh green vegetables vitamin k
many minerals are also essential in small quantities including iron calcium magnesium sodium chloride and sulfur and in very small quantities copper zinc and selenium
the micronutrients minerals and vitamins15 in fruit and vegetables may be destroyed or eluted by cooking
vitamin c is especially prone to oxidation during cooking and may be completely destroyed by protracted cooking
16failed verification the bioavailability of some vitamins such as thiamin vitamin b6 niacin folate and carotenoids are increased with cooking by being freed from the food microstructure
17 blanching or steaming vegetables is a way of minimizing vitamin and mineral loss in cooking
there are very many methods of cooking most of which have been known since antiquity
these include baking roasting frying grilling barbecuing smoking boiling steaming and braising
a more recent innovation is microwaving
various methods use differing levels of heat and moisture and vary in cooking time
the method chosen greatly affects the end result because some foods are more appropriate to some methods than others
some major hot cooking techniques include
cooking can prevent many foodborne illnesses that would otherwise occur if the food is eaten raw
when heat is used in the preparation of food it can kill or inactivate harmful organisms such as bacteria and viruses as well as various parasites such as tapeworms and toxoplasma gondii
food poisoning and other illness from uncooked or poorly prepared food may be caused by bacteria such as pathogenic strains of escherichia coli salmonella typhimurium and campylobacter viruses such as noroviruses and protozoa such as entamoeba histolytica
bacteria viruses and parasites may be introduced through salad meat that is uncooked or done rare and unboiled water
18
the sterilizing effect of cooking depends on temperature cooking time and technique used
some food spoilage bacteria such as clostridium botulinum or bacillus cereus can form spores that survive boiling which then germinate and regrow after the food has cooled
this makes it unsafe to reheat cooked food more than once
19
cooking increases the digestibility of many foods which are inedible or poisonous when raw
for example raw cereal grains are hard to digest while kidney beans are toxic when raw or improperly cooked due to the presence of phytohaemagglutinin which is inactivated by cooking for at least ten minutes at 100 212
20
food safety depends on the safe preparation handling and storage of food
food spoilage bacteria proliferate in the danger zone temperature range from 40 to 140 4 to 60 food therefore should not be stored in this temperature range
washing of hands and surfaces especially when handling different meats and keeping raw food separate from cooked food to avoid crosscontamination21 are good practices in food preparation
22 foods prepared on plastic cutting boards may be less likely to harbor bacteria than wooden ones
2324 washing and disinfecting cutting boards especially after use with raw meat poultry or seafood reduces the risk of contamination
24
proponents of raw foodism argue that cooking food increases the risk of some of the detrimental effects on food or health
they point out that during cooking of vegetables and fruit containing vitamin c the vitamin elutes into the cooking water and becomes degraded through oxidation
peeling vegetables can also substantially reduce the vitamin c content especially in the case of potatoes where most vitamin c is in the skin
25 however research has shown that in the specific case of carotenoids a greater proportion is absorbed from cooked vegetables than from raw vegetables
16
german research in 2003 showed significant benefits in reducing breast cancer risk when large amounts of raw vegetable matter are included in the diet
the authors attribute some of this effect to heatlabile phytonutrients
26 sulforaphane a glucosinolate breakdown product which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer however much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled
2728
the usda has studied retention data for 16 vitamins 8 minerals and alcohol for approximately 290 foods for various cooking methods
29
in a human epidemiological analysis by richard doll and richard peto in 1981 diet was estimated to cause a large percentage of cancers
30 studies suggest that around 32 of cancer deaths may be avoidable by changes to the diet
31 some of these cancers may be caused by carcinogens in food generated during the cooking process although it is often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase cancer risk
many foods such as beef steak and broccoli contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens
32
several studies published since 1990 indicate that cooking meat at high temperature creates heterocyclic amines hcas which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans
researchers at the national cancer institute found that human subjects who ate beef rare or mediumrare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef mediumwell or welldone
33 while avoiding meat or eating meat raw may be the only ways to avoid hcas in meat fully the national cancer institute states that cooking meat below 212 100 creates negligible amounts of hcas
also microwaving meat before cooking may reduce hcas by 90 by reducing the time needed for the meat to be cooked at high heat
33 nitrosamines are found in some food and may be produced by some cooking processes from proteins or from nitrites used as food preservatives cured meat such as bacon has been found to be carcinogenic with links to colon cancer
ascorbate which is added to cured meat however reduces nitrosamine formation
3234
research has shown that grilling barbecuing and smoking meat and fish increases levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah
in europe grilled meat and smoked fish generally only contribute a small proportion of dietary pah intake since they are a minor component of diet most intake comes from cereals oils and fats
35 however in the us grilledbarbecued meat is the second highest contributor of the mean daily intake of a known pah carcinogen benzoapyrene at 21 after bread cereal and grain at 29
35
baking grilling or broiling food especially starchy foods until a toasted crust is formed generates significant concentrations of acrylamide a known carcinogen from animal studies its potential to cause cancer in humans at normal exposures is uncertain
36 public health authorities recommend reducing the risk by avoiding overly browning starchy foods or meats when frying baking toasting or roasting them
36
cooking dairy products may reduce a protective effect against colon cancer
researchers at the university of toronto suggest that ingesting uncooked or unpasteurized dairy products see also raw milk may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer
37 mice and rats fed uncooked sucrose casein and beef tallow had onethird to onefifth the incidence of microadenomas as the mice and rats fed the same ingredients cooked
3839 this claim however is contentious
according to the food and drug administration of the united states health benefits claimed by raw milk advocates do not exist
the small quantities of antibodies in milk are not absorbed in the human intestinal tract says barbara ingham phd associate professor and extension food scientist at the university of wisconsinmadison
there is no scientific evidence that raw milk contains an antiarthritis factor or that it enhances resistance to other diseases
40
heating sugars with proteins or fats can produce advanced glycation end products glycotoxins
41
deep fried food in restaurants may contain high level of trans fat which is known to increase levels of lowdensity lipoprotein that in turn may increase risk of heart diseases and other conditions
however many fast food chains have now switched to transfatfree alternatives for deepfrying
42
the application of scientific knowledge to cooking and gastronomy has become known as molecular gastronomy
this is a subdiscipline of food science
important contributions have been made by scientists chefs and authors such as herve this chemist nicholas kurti physicist peter barham physicist harold mcgee author shirley corriher biochemist author heston blumenthal chef ferran adria chef robert wolke chemist author and pierre gagnaire chef
43
chemical processes central to cooking include the maillard reaction a form of nonenzymatic browning involving an amino acid a reducing sugar and heat
44
home cooking has traditionally been a process carried out informally in a home or around a communal fire and can be enjoyed by all members of the family although in many cultures women bear primary responsibility
45 cooking is also often carried out outside of personal quarters for example at restaurants or schools
bakeries were one of the earliest forms of cooking outside the home and bakeries in the past often offered the cooking of pots of food provided by their customers as an additional service
in the present day factory food preparation has become common with many readytoeat foods being prepared and cooked in factories and home cooks using a mixture of scratch made and factory made foods together to make a meal
the nutritional value of including more commercially prepared foods has been found to be inferior to homemade foods
46 homecooked meals tend to be healthier with fewer calories and less saturated fat cholesterol and sodium on a per calorie basis while providing more fiber calcium and iron
47 the ingredients are also directly sourced so there is control over authenticity taste and nutritional value
the superior nutritional quality of homecooking could therefore play a role in preventing chronic disease
48 cohort studies following the elderly over 10 years show that adults who cook their own meals have significantly lower mortality even when controlling for confounding variables
49
homecooking may be associated with comfort food50 and some commercially produced foods and restaurant meals are presented through advertising or packaging as having been homecooked regardless of their actual origin
this trend began in the 1920s and is attributed to people in urban areas of the us wanting homestyle food even though their schedules and smaller kitchens made cooking harder
51
a cooking schoola is an institution devoted to education in the art and science of cooking and food preparation
there are many different types of cooking schools around the world some devoted to training professional chefs others aimed at amateur enthusiasts with some being a mixture of the two
amateur cooking schools are often intertwined with culinary tourism in many countries
programs can vary from half a day to several years
some programs lead to an academic degree or a recognized vocational qualification while others do not
many programs include practical experience in the kitchen of a restaurant attached to the school or a period of work experience in a privately owned restaurant
culinary education in the united states is a fairly new concept in relation to culinary education in europe
charles ranhoffer chef of the early fine dining restaurant delmonicos published a national magazine named chef in 1898 which included one of the first calls to establish a training school for cooks in the united states
until this point ranhoffer had been looking to europe to solve his staffing problems however it began to be too expensive and too much work
in 1911 the united states promoted a system similar to the european one in which apprentices would have to complete a 6000hour work commitment in order to become certified as a chef
the first significant private cooking school in america was the boston cooking school which was created in 1877 however one of the most notable was the creation of the culinary institute of america in 1946
the culinary institute of america brought about a new way to better educate culinary professionals by teaching students the theory behind their future work and also requiring them to complete an 18week paid internship at an approved restaurant requiring them to create at least 51 percent of their product from scratch
the school uses mainly handson teaching styles ensuring that students learn through experience
some schools such as le cordon bleu1 offer programs through which a chef may demonstrate his or her knowledge and skills and be given certification
others such as baltimore international college stratford university johnson and wales university and the culinary institute of america2 offer programs whereby students gain either an associates or bachelors degree
there are also a few such as ivy tech community college of indiana manchester community college in connecticut los angeles trade technical college in california or where students receive upon graduation not only an associates degree but also certification by the american culinary federation the largest professional chefs organization in north america
34
in recipes quantities of ingredients may be specified by mass commonly called weight by volume or by count
for most of history most cookbooks did not specify quantities precisely instead talking of a nice leg of spring lamb a cupful of lentils a piece of butter the size of a small apricot and sufficient salt
informal measurements such as a pinch a drop or a hint soupçon continue to be used from time to time
in the us fannie farmer introduced the more exact specification of quantities by volume in her 1896 boston cookingschool cook book
today most of the world prefers metric measurement by weight though the preference for volume measurements continues among home cooks in the united states almost exclusively and the rest of north america
different ingredients are measured in different ways
liquid ingredients are generally measured by volume worldwide
dry bulk ingredients such as sugar and flour are measured by weight in most of the world 250 g flour and by volume in north america 12 cup flour
small quantities of salt and spices are generally measured by volume worldwide as few households have sufficiently precise balances to measure by weight
meats are generally specified by weight or count worldwide a 2 kg chicken four lamb chops
eggs are usually specified by count
vegetables are usually specified by weight or occasionally by count despite the inherent imprecision of counts given the variability in the size of vegetables
in most of the world recipes use the metric system of units—litres l and millilitres ml grams g and kilograms kg and degrees celsius
the official spelling litre is used in most englishspeaking nations the notable exception is the united states where the spelling liter is preferred
the usa measures weight in pounds avoirdupois while recipes in the uk tend to include both imperial and metric measures following the advice of the guild of food writers
the usa also uses volume measures based on cooking utensils and premetric measures
the actual values frequently deviate from the utensils on which they were based and there is little consistency from one country to another
in south australia a pint of beer is traditionally 425 ml while most other states have metricated this value to 570 ml
the volumetric measures here are for comparison only
see below for the definition of gallon for more details
in addition the cooks cup above is not the same as a coffee cup which can vary anywhere from 100 to 200 ml 35 to 70 imp fl oz 34 to 68 us fl oz or even smaller for espresso
in australia since 1970 metric utensil units have been standardized by law and imperial measures no longer have legal status
however it is wise to measure the actual volume of the utensil measures particularly the australian tablespoon see above since many are imported from other countries with different values
dessertspoons are standardized as part of the metric system at 10 ml though they are not normally used in contemporary recipes
australia is the only metricated country with a metric tablespoon of 20 ml unlike other countries that metricated which have a 15 ml metric tablespoon
in europe older recipes frequently refer to pounds eg
pfund in german pond in dutch livre in french
in each case the unit refers to 500 g about 10 more than an avoirdupois pound 454 g
dutch recipes may also use the ons which is 100 g
with the advent of accurate electronic scales it has become more common to weigh liquids for use in recipes avoiding the need for accurate volumetric utensils
the most common liquids used in cooking are water and milk milk having approximately the same density as water
1 ml of water weighs 1 gram so a recipe calling for 300 ml imperial pint of water can simply be substituted with 300 g 10 oz
of water
1 fluid ounce of water weighs approximately 1 ounce so a recipe calling for a uk pint 20 fl oz of water can be substituted with 20 oz of water
more accurate measurements become important in the large volumes used in commercial food production
also a home cook can use greater precision at times
water at 40 392 may be volumetrically measured then weighed to determine an unknown measuringutensil volume without the need for a waterdensity adjustment
the us uses pounds and ounces avoirdupois for weight and us customary units for volume
for measures used in cookbooks published in other nations navigate to the appropriate regional section in traditional measurement systems
measures are classified as either dry measures or fluid measures
some of the fluid and dry measures have similar names but the actual measured volume is quite different
a recipe will generally specify which measurement is required
us recipes are commonly in terms of fluid measures even for dry ingredients
most of these units derive from earlier english units as applied to the us gallon
typically they follow a pattern of binary submultiples where each larger measure consists of two units of the nextsmallest measure
an exception is with the commonly used teaspoon as onethird of a tablespoon
binary submultiples are fractional parts obtained by successively dividing by the number 2
thus onehalf onefourth oneeighth onesixteenth and so on are binary submultiples
the system can be traced back to the measuring systems of the hindus and the ancient egyptians who subdivided the hekat about 48 litres into parts of ​12 ​14​18 ​116 ​132 and ​164 1 ro or mouthful or about 145 ml and the hin similarly down to ​132 1 ro using hieratic notation as early as the fifth dynasty of egypt 2494 to 2345 bc thus making the english doubling system at least 4300 years old
the introduction of measures that dont follow the system combined with the dropping from common use of a few measures essential to the continuity of the system dessertspoon wineglass and pottle combined with the redefinition of the teaspoon from ​18 to ​16 of a fl oz has gradually left the system littleunderstood
however it is still a legal basis for measures in some states such as massachusetts which mandates that glass bottles or jars used for the sale of milk or cream to the consumer shall be of the capacity of one gallon a multiple of the gallon or a binary submultiple of the gallon
metric equivalents are based upon one of two nearly equivalent systems
in the standard system the conversion is that 1 gallon 231 cubic inches and 1 inch 254 cm giving that a gallon 3785411784 millilitres exactly
for nutritional labeling on food packages in the us the teaspoon is defined as exactly 5 ml giving 1 gallon 3840 ml exactly
this chart uses the former
in domestic cooking bulk solids notably flour and sugar are measured by volume often cups though they are sold by weight at retail
weight measures are used for meat
butter may be measured by either weight ​14 lb or volume 3 tbsp or a combination of weight and volume ​14 lb plus 3 tbsp it is sold by weight but in packages marked to facilitate common divisions by eye
as a subpackaged unit a stick of butter at ​14 lb 113 g is a de facto measure in the us
cookbooks in canada use the same system although pints and gallons would be taken as their imperial quantities unless specified otherwise
following the adoption of the metric system recipes in canada are frequently published with metric conversions
there are a variety of approximate units of measures which are frequently undefined by any official source or which have had conflicting definitions over time yet which are commonly used
the measurement units that are most commonly understood to be approximate are the drop smidgen pinch and dash yet nearly all of the traditional cooking measurement units lack statutory definitions or even any definition by any organization authorized to set standards in the us for example of the table above only the fluid ounce pint quart and gallon are officially defined by the nist
all of the others appear only in conversion guides lacking statutory authority or in nowobsolete publications of the us pharmacopeial convention or usp—essentially the apothecaries system—which still has authority to define certain drug and supplement standards
the usp has longsince abandoned apothecaries measurements and even now recommends against using teaspoons to measure doses of medicine
note that measurements in this section are in imperial units
british imperial measures distinguish between weight and volume
weight is measured in ounces and pounds avoirdupois as in the us
volume is measured in imperial gallons quarts pints and fluid ounces
the imperial gallon was originally defined as 10 pounds 45359 kg of water in 1824 and refined as exactly 454609 litres in 1985
older recipes may well give measurements in cups insofar as a standard cup was used it was usually ​12 pint 285 ml or sometimes ​13 pint 190 ml but if the recipe is one that has been handed down in a family it is just as likely to refer to someones favourite kitchen cup as to that standard
please also note british recipe books tend to refer to ​12 pint or 10 fluid ounces instead of a single cup for volumeamerican cooks using british recipes and vice versa need to be careful with pints and fluid ounces
a us pint is 473 ml while a uk pint is 568 ml about 20 larger
a us fluid ounce is ​116 of a us pint 296 ml a uk fluid ounce is ​120 uk pint 284 ml
this makes an imperial pint equivalent to 192 us fluid ounces
on a larger scale perhaps for institutional cookery an imperial gallon is eight imperial pints 160 imp fl oz 4546 litres whereas the us gallon is eight us pints 128 us fl oz 3785 litres
the metric system was officially adopted in the uk for most purposes in the 20th century and both imperial and metric are taught in schools and used in books
it is now mandatory for the sale of food to also show metric
however it is not uncommon to purchase goods which are measured and labeled in metric but the actual measure is rounded to the equivalent imperial measure ie milk labeled as 568 ml 1 pint
in september 2007 the eu with directive 200745ec deregulated prescribed metric packaging of most products leaving only wines and liqueurs subject to prescribed euwide prepackaging legislation the law relating to labelling of products remaining unchanged
volume measures of compressible ingredients have a substantial measurement uncertainty in the case of flour of about 20
some volumebased recipes therefore attempt to improve the reproducibility by including additional instructions for measuring the correct amount of an ingredient
for example a recipe might call for 1 cup brown sugar firmly packed or 2 heaping cups flour
a few of the more common special measuring methods
firmly packed
with a spatula a spoon or by hand the ingredient is pressed as tightly as possible into the measuring devicelightly packed
the ingredient is pressed lightly into the measuring device only tightly enough to ensure no air pocketseven level
a precise measure of an ingredient discarding all of the ingredient that rises above the rim of the measuring device
sweeping across the top of the measure with the back of a straight knife or the blade of a spatula is a common leveling methodrounded
allowing a measure of an ingredient to pile up above the rim of the measuring device naturally into a soft rounded shapeheaping heaped
the maximum amount of an ingredient which will stay on the measuring devicesifted
this instruction may be seen in two different ways with two different meanings before the ingredient as 1 cup sifted flour indicates the ingredient should be sifted into the measuring device and normally leveled while after the ingredient as 1 cup flour sifted denotes the sifting should occur after measurementsuch special instructions are unnecessary in weightbased recipes

a cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients techniques and dishes and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region
regional food preparation traditions customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a particular region
1
a cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade they can even be made into distinct ingredients themselves when they become popular within a region take for example japanese rice in japanese cuisine and new mexico chile in new mexican cuisine
religious food laws can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine such as hinduism in indian cuisine sikhism in punjabi cuisine buddhism in east asian cuisine islam in middle eastern cuisine and judaism in jewish cuisine and israeli cuisine
some factors that have an influence on a regions cuisine include the areas climate the trade among different countries religious or sumptuary laws and culinary culture exchange
for example a tropical diet may be based more on fruits and vegetables while a polar diet might rely more on meat and fish
the areas climate in large measure determines the native foods that are available
in addition climate influences food preservation
for example foods preserved for winter consumption by smoking curing and pickling have remained significant in world cuisines for their altered gustatory properties
the trade among different countries also largely affects a regions cuisine
dating back to the ancient spice trade seasonings such as cinnamon cassia cardamom ginger and turmeric were important items of commerce in the earliest evolution of trade
cinnamon and cassia found their way to the middle east at least 4000 years ago
2
certain foods and food preparations are required or proscribed by the religiousness or sumptuary laws such as islamic dietary laws and jewish dietary laws
culinary culture exchange is also an important factor for cuisine in many regions japans first substantial and direct exposure to the west came with the arrival of european missionaries in the second half of the 16th century
at that time the combination of spanish and portuguese game frying techniques with an east asian method for cooking vegetables in oil led to the development of tempura the popular japanese dish in which seafood and many different types of vegetables are coated with batter and deep fried
3
cuisine dates back to the antiquity
as food began to require more planning there was an emergence of meals that situated around culture
4
cuisines evolve continually and new cuisines are created by innovation and cultural interaction
one recent example is fusion cuisine which combines elements of various culinary traditions while not being categorized per any one cuisine style and generally refers to the innovations in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s

a global cuisine is a cuisine that is practiced around the world and can be categorized according to the common use of major foodstuffs including grains produce and cooking fats
regional cuisines can vary based on availability and usage of specific ingredients local cooking traditions and practices as well as overall cultural differences
9 such factors can be moreorless uniform across wide swaths of territory or vary intensely within individual regions
for example in central and north south america corn maize both fresh and dried is a staple food and is used in many different ways
in northern europe wheat rye and fats of animal origin predominate while in southern europe olive oil is ubiquitous and rice is more prevalent
in italy the cuisine of the north featuring butter and rice stands in contrast to that of the south with its wheat pasta and olive oil
in some parts of china rice is the staple while in others this role is filled by noodles and bread
throughout the middle east and mediterranean common ingredients include lamb olive oil lemons peppers and rice
the vegetarianism practiced in much of india has made pulses crops harvested solely for the dry seed such as chickpeas and lentils as important as wheat or rice
from india to indonesia the extensive use of spices is characteristic coconuts and seafood are also used throughout the region both as foodstuffs and as seasonings
african cuisines use a combination of locally available fruits cereals and vegetables as well as milk and meat products
in some parts of the continent the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk curd and whey products
in much of tropical africa however cows milk is rare and can not be produced locally owing to various diseases that affect livestock
the continents diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits dishes and preparation techniques of its manifold populations

the word denature means to render food unpleasant or dangerous to consume it is denatured by adding a substance known as a denaturant
aversive agents—primarily bitterants and pungent agents—are used to produce an unpleasant flavor
for example the bitterant denatonium might be added to food used in a laboratory where such food is not intended for human consumption
a poisonous substance may be added as an even more powerful deterrent
for example methanol is blended with ethanol to produce denatured alcohol
the addition of methanol which is poisonous renders denatured alcohol unfit for consumption as ingesting denatured alcohol may result in serious injury or death
thus denatured alcohol is not subject to the taxes usually levied on the production and sale of alcoholic beverages
aniline was used to denature colza oil in the 1980s
a garde manger pronounced  french for keeper of the food is a cool wellventilated area where cold dishes such as salads hors dœuvres appetizers canapés pâtés and terrines are prepared and other foods are stored under refrigeration
the person in charge of this area is known as the chef garde manger or pantry chef
larger hotels and restaurants may have garde manger staff to perform additional duties such as creating decorative elements of buffet presentation like ice carving and edible centerpieces
the term garde manger originated in prerevolutionary france
at that time maintaining a large supply of food and beverage was an outward symbol of power wealth and status
it is because of this duty of supervising the preserving of food and managing its utilization that many interpret the term garde manger as keeping to eat
the term garde manger is also related to the cold rooms inside castles and manor houses where the food was stored
these food storage areas were usually located in the lower levels since the cool basementlike environment was ideal for storing food
these cold storage areas developed over time into the modern cold kitchenmost merchants who worked outside noble manors at this time were associated with a guild an association of persons of the same trade formed for their mutual aid and protection
guilds would develop training programs for their members thereby preserving their knowledge and skills
charcuterie was the name of a guild that prepared and sold cooked items made from pigs
through this organization the preparation of hams bacon sausages pâtés and terrines were preserved
when the guild system was abolished in 1791 following the french revolution of 1789 garde mangers took on the responsibility for tasks that had formerly been performed by charcutieres who had difficulty competing with the versatile garde mangers due to the limited range of skills involved
the position of butcher first developed as a specialty within the garde manger kitchen
as both the cost of and demand for animal meats increased more space was required for the task of fabricating and portioning the raw meats
this increased need for space was due not only to an upswing in the volume of meat sales but also to the need for separating raw meats from processed foods to avoid crosscontamination and the resulting possibility of foodborne illness
modern garde manger can refer to different things in the professional kitchen
in many restaurants it is a station which is generally an entrylevel cooking position within a restaurant as it often involves preparing salads or other smaller plates which can be heated and quickly plated without significant experience
in other highprofile classically influenced restaurants and hotels the position pertains to the classical preparations which often include pâtés terrines and elaborate aspics
this is a list of cooking techniques commonly used in cooking and food preparation
cooking is the art of preparing food for ingestion commonly with the application of heat
cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world reflecting unique environments economics cultural traditions and trends

culinary arts basics the fundamentals of cooking
mise en place french pronunciation ​mi plas is a french culinary phrase which means putting in place or everything in its place
it refers to the setup required before cooking and is often used in professional kitchens to refer to organizing and arranging the ingredients eg cuts of meat relishes sauces parcooked items spices freshly chopped vegetables and other components that a cook will require for the menu items that are expected to be prepared during a shift
1
the practice can be applied in home kitchens
23
in the kitchen the phrase is used as a noun ie the setup of the array of ingredients a verb ie the process of preparing and a state of mind
4 the terms broader meanings can be applied to classrooms hospitals and elsewhere
4
the term has also been used outside of cooking psychologists weisberg et al used the phrase to refer to how ones stance towards a given environment places constraints on what one feels able to do within that environment and how these assessments and predispositions impact the process of preparing to act
they used the term in a study of how a school became safer after security measures like metal detectors and bars on the windows were removed leading to the unexpected outcome
5
outdoor cooking differs substantially from kitchenbased cooking the most obvious difference being lack of an easily defined kitchen area
as a result campers and backpackers have developed a significant body of techniques and specialized equipment for preparing food in outdoors environments
such techniques have traditionally been associated with nomadic cultures such as the berbers of north africa the arab beduins the plains indians and pioneers of north america and have been carried down to and refined in modern times for use during recreational outdoors pursuits
currently much of the work of maintaining and developing outdoor cooking traditions in westernized countries is done by the scouting movement and by wilderness educators such as the national outdoor leadership school and outward bound as well as by writers and cooks closely associated with the outdoors community
the type of food common in outdoors settings is somewhat different compared to household foods and also differs depending on the type of cooking activity
while someone at a public campground may have easy access to a grocery store and be able to prepare plenty of recipes with fresh meat and vegetables someone on an extended trip into the backcountry will not be able to carry large amounts of fresh food due to the extra weight from high water content and will have to rely heavily on food with a low water content such as dried meats and vegetables packaged dehydrated camping foods and starches such as ramen polenta and dried potato flakes
wilderness experts in both categories sometimes make use of locally available wild foods as well particularly wild vegetables and fruit but also occasionally fresh fish and wild game however it is not unusual for camping food especially backcountry food to be partially or totally vegetarian
camping food is often very high in fat and carbohydrates to provide energy for long hikes and hikers much like soldiers must rely heavily on energypacked snacks such as trail mix chocolate energy bars and sports drinks
water can also be at a premium so important parts of a campers pantry include chlorine or iodinebased water disinfectants as well as drink mixes to mask the flavor of the chemical treatment
recipes are often designed with significant planning and home preparation in mind with certain ingredients mixed at home and then cooked on the trail to that end there are a number of providers of freezedried food both ingredients and full meals to the outdoors market and justaddwater instant meals including hot cereals pasta or rice in sauce and instant soup from the supermarket are popular as well
alternatively some wilderness experts advocate bulk rationing in which each hiker is given a selection of raw ingredients and prepares a meal from scratch on the trail
most outdoor cooking is dictated by the foods themselves which are to be cooked
the first five discussions below of direct heat boiling frying grilling and roasting will perhaps describe the cooking methods employed most often in outdoor cooking
these techniques will require only rudimentary commonsensical tools
additional methods described farther below may be of interest only to those foodies who carry their interests into the outdoors for gourmet meals
these advanced methods may require additional equipment or techniques
the most traditional method for outdoor cooking and indeed the oldest form of cooking known to humanity is by means of a campfire
campfires can be used for cooking food by a number of techniques
the techniques for cooking on a campfire are no different from those used for everyday cooking before the invention of stoves or where stoves are still not available
individuals who are backpacking in an area that allows the gathering of firewood may decide to cook on a campfire to avoid the need to carry extra equipment however most campfire cooking is done in outside of wilderness areas
cooking food using a campfire can be tricky for those not accustomed to it also due to risk of fire damage campfires are illegal in many areas so many campers prefer to use a portable stove instead
in backpacking particularly boiling water is the most common kitchen operation undertaken on the trail used for cooking or reconstituting food making hot beverages cleaning up and even sanitizing drinking water
portable stoves are therefore generally rated in terms of how quickly they can boil a liter or other appropriate size of water indeed some commercial stove models are specifically optimized for fast boiling with other operations such as frying or baking being an afterthought
like camp frying pans camp pots are generally made of very lightweight material often aluminum or at a considerable price premium titanium
though less of a worry given the thermal mass of water the camp cook must still take care not to allow food to burn since the pot itself has very little mass to spread the heat out
alternatively a fireproof container eg
mess can bamboo segment or improvised tree bark pot is placed or hung above the fire
possibly the simplest method of cooking over a campfire and one of the most common is to roast food on long skewers that can be held above the flames
this is popular for cooking hot dogs or toasting marshmallows for making smores
hungarians often roast slab bacon szalonna over a campfire
besides skewers and fireplace popcorn popper pie irons too may be used small iron molds with long handles into which can be placed slices of bread with some form of filling which are placed over hot coals to cook
when using meat roasting can have the advantage over grilling in that the grease that drips from the food can be reused
this can be done by placing a fireproof container under the food
grills are simple to use and food being grilled tends to pick up some flavor from the smoke although that is not by design as in a barbecue where the meat is cooked slowly over a period of hours at a significantly lower temperature
grills over a campfire are used in the same way as an ordinary backyard charcoal grill
if the food is simply placed on the grill it may catch fire so it requires constant attention
handheld grills aka broiler that clamp over the food may be used for various tasks like warming food grilling burgers or sausages or making toast
in cases where open fires are not allowed lightweight charcoal grills sometimes considered a type of hibachi are sometimes used for direct grilling of food
frying is not always necessary but is often used for fish or wild game caught while on the trip as well as pancakes and certain kinds of bread and desserts made on the trail
as a general rule the frying medium used in camp cooking is usually either vegetable oil or margarine
normal salted butter may also be appropriate for camp use but unsalted butter or lard may not be due to their shorter shelf life
camp frying pans often lack handles for easy packing with the camp cook using a clamplike device to pick up and move the pan
camp frying pans are generally made out of very thin metal though some campers do use cast iron pans for this purpose as well so extra care must be taken to evenly cook the food especially over the smalldiameter flame of a portable stove
a round the clock technique where the frying pan is moved repeatedly to expose different parts of its base to the flame is the most commonly recommended solution to the problem though it is also possible to use a flame diffuser to achieve the same effect
for campfire use on the other hand some camp cooks prefer a legged castiron pan called a spider which is elevated to allow a small fire directly beneath it
camp cooks making pancakes in a moderatesize pan often simplify their work and speed up their service by pouring enough batter to make one large moderatethickness pancake that takes up the entire pan and then cutting the final product with the spatula to serve individual portions
also camp cooks often replicate toast using a fry pan a bread slice or more or a combination of whole and cut portions are placed in a well greased pan pressed down with spatula flipped and pressed down again
an improvised griddle can be made by putting a flat stone directly on the fire or above it on top of other stones
food is then placed on the stone
putting a baking sheet pan over a furnace can allow for baking which is in turn derived from the concept of the masonry oven
this was common for centuries used to make breads pies and other items and is still popular today particularly among campers who enjoy stuffing their meats
ovens can be made from cast iron sheet metal or aluminum foil covered cardboard box
reflector ovens are metal containers designed to surround an article of food being baked over an open flame and reflect the heat back towards the food
closely associated with the american old west the dutch oven of tradition is a heavy cast iron pot traditionally made with three short legs and a concave cover for holding hot coals on top
while such pots are generally considered too heavy for backpackers dutch ovens are often used in group campouts and cookouts
dutch ovens were traditionally specially designed for camping and such pots often with legs and a handle both for suspending the pot over a fire are still widely available though sometimes at a premium over flatbottomed stovetop models
the oven is placed in a bed of hot coals often from a keyhole fire with additional coals placed on top of the lid which in camp ovens usually has a raised rim to keep the coals from falling off
dutch ovens are made of cast iron or aluminium and are generally not considered suitable for backpacking due to the heavy weight of the pot
dutch ovens are convenient for cooking dishes that take a long time such as stews joints of meat and baked goods
they are not the only option for baking on a campout as devices for baking on portable stoves exist and clay ovens can be constructed at longer encampments
a pot hanging over the fire although picturesque may spill and the rigging may be difficult to construct from found wood
generally this is done with metal rigging much of it identical to that historically used in home fireplaces before the invention of stoves
two vertical iron bars with an iron crosspiece allow pots to be hung at various heights or over different temperatures of fire
griddles grills and skewers can also be hung over the fire
when working with wood one may use two tripods lashed with tripod lashings but the rope will be liable to melt or burn
dovetail joints are more secure but difficult to carve
a good alternative to cooking with a tripod is to cook directly upon the fire itself
to do this properly the fire needs to have a reasonable bed of coals and to have burned down to the point where it is not a roaring fire
while the pot may be set directly upon the coals this is not preferable since that will tend to extinguish the coals
to lift the pot up off the fire often two small logs of similar size may be used on either side of the pot campstyle dutch ovens have three legs built into the pot to perform this function
an alternative is the use of a metal thread or mesh fire basket
this allows continued airflow through the fire while providing optimal heat
the one down side to this form of cooking is that the pots will become blackened with soot and ash which can be difficult to scrub off
the ash and soot build up can be easily avoided by applying a thin layer of dish soap preferably biodegradable to the outside of the pot before cooking
the ash and soot will stick to the soap which is then easily rinsed off later
steaming is possible with plants such as bamboo
in this method a piece of bamboo is set diagonally above a fire
the bamboo is perforated from within between the joints and water is placed in the lowest bamboo segment
food eg
rice is then placed in the top segment which is steamed due to the water evaporating from the heat in the lowest segment

the original form of covered cooking is the earth oven simply a covered pit with a fire built in it demonstrated in techniques such as the polynesian umuhāngi the indian tandoori and the native american clambake
another commonly used technique is the baking of food in aluminum foil packets
food is wrapped inside a durable packet of tin or aluminum foil crimped to seal and placed on or under hot coals
baked potatoes are commonly cooked this way but entire meals can be cooked in one packet
besides aluminum or tin organic material such as leaves of tree nelumbo nucifera lotus dendrocalamus latiflorus munro bamboo aka bambusa oldhamii phragmites plantain taro etc
husks of corn phyllostachys makinoi bamboo etc
and skins of fruit citrus etc
are also frequently employed
tree leaves such as those from the banana tree do not burnignite as they contain enough oil to resist the heat from the flames at least until the frying is complete
the way to adapt recipes where food is wrapped in foil is to use a barrier such as baking or silicone paper between the food and the foil the overall technique is similar to the en papillote technique developed in french cuisine but uses a more robust container
other simple methods include clay wrapping food such as in the kleftiko method used in greek cuisine leaf wrapping and plank grilling2 where food is cooked on a wooden plank set above the fire
hotstone cooking where food is placed on a heated stone next to or even in the fire or where fireheated stones are dropped into a pot are other methods
longdistance truckers automotive travelers and rally racers have occasionally resorted to cooking on accessible sections of the vehicle engine the book manifold destiny though written to a certain extent as a humor book is considered the authoritative reference on the subject
the food is usually wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil and secured onto the engine block or other hot parts of the engine
in some areas where there is a significant amount of steady lesshazardous volcanic activity lava cooking invented in hawaii is sometimes practiced as a novelty
3 the food does not come in direct contact with the molten rock instead being wrapped in a moist barrier usually wet tropical leaves such as banana foliage or ti leaves
the wrapper is sacrificial and is chipped or otherwise cleaned off along with the cooled lava before serving
backwoods cooking is a method of cooking without the use of kitchen implements
4 it commonly takes place in the backwoods often in combination with wild or conventional camping
some variants of backwoods cooking allow the use of items of cookware such as a cooking pot5 however there are many recipes without any
some backwoods alternatives to cookware include aluminium foil4 fruit skins6 and heated stones
7 traditionally backwoods cooking takes place over a woodburning fire because wood is the most available fuel source in the backwoods
8 as a result some recipes include information about the intensity of the fire to be used

backwoods cooking is widely practiced within the scouting movement
while it is most associated with scouting today the term backwoods cooking predates scouting by at least 25 years
9 within scouting it may also be known as lightweight cooking which may also have a focus on using aluminium foil for cookware for much lighter weight cooking
10
scouts around the world take part in different backwoods cooking competitions
11 these competitions are often local in scope group or district competitions but some are held by national scout associations such as that held by the scout association of malta
12
portable stoves are widely used in areas where fuel such as wood is scarce or there is a significant fire or environmental hazard to building a campfire
such devices usually use a liquid fuel usually a petroleum derivative or some kind of alcohol but gaseous fuels like propane butane and solid fuels such as wood shavings and hexamine are also used depending on the stove design while twoburner models are commonly used for frontcountry campstoves and function much like residential gas stoves backpacking stoves generally put out a much more concentrated and less powerful flame and require lightweight cooking equipment billycans made of aluminum or titanium rather than more typical kitchentype utensils
in addition there are often special techniques for baked goods made on the trail in the absence of specialized camp oven equipment including flipping over the lidded pan while on the heat and the twiggy fire which mimics the use of charcoal on the lid of a dutch oven using a small campfire on the lid of the pan
13
reflector ovens are placed on the ground next to the fire and gather thermal radiation from it
solar cookers are a type of equipment that are powered by the sun and no other fuel is required creating a positive environmental impact
there are large variations of design and functionality where the parabolic solar cookers offer the highest temperature often more than 750 degrees f solsource solar stove is an example of a hightemperature solar stove
ceramic grills come in many guises and have been around in simple format since ancient times
many modern cookers sport ornate designs that can be quite beautiful
these grills cook well and efficiently because they retain heat and seal in moisture
most quality grills are weatherproof and can be used yearround to grill bbq smoke and bake
other benefits include fast heating time and a lack of hotspots
they are fuelefficient using a minimum of charcoal and may be safer for children due to the lack of hotspots

outdoor cooking elements can be of danger due to their high flammability and proximity to occupants
use of highly flammable alcohols to refuel portable cookers gas cookers need to be checked for leaks and kept well away from heat and tents in a sheltered and stable setting
most modern tents are made of lightweight synthetic materials that are not fire retardant
fires and flames must properly extinguished and not left unattended
wind can carry hot embers possibly igniting wildfires
in rare occasions portable camping canisters have been known to explode
these can be caused by leaks or overheating around the compressed canister
adequate air ventilation can prevent overheating during use
it is recommended to operate such portable cooking instruments in the open despite the pull of luxury in having them operate inside a tent
a number of incidents involving camping and cooking fires have resulted in fatalities14 and severe injuries
15
special precautions are required for camping in bear country because cooking activities and food storage attract these potentially dangerous animals
food preparation and storage must be located a safe distance from sleeping areas so a fire near camp can not be used for cooking
16 food may need to be stored in bear cans or bear bags hung from a tree or post
other animals may be attracted to food too most notably raccoons squirrels skunks and mice
the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to food preparation
food preparation art form and applied science that includes but is not limited to cooking
art an art one of the arts is a creative endeavor or discipline
culinary art art of preparing and cooking foods
skill learned capacity to carry out predetermined results often with the minimum outlay of time energy or both
meal preparation the process of planning mealsincludes types of ingredients needed and the correct preparation of the ingredients for the food item being made
chef a person who cooks professionally for other people
although over time the term has come to describe any person who cooks for a living traditionally it refers to a highly skilled professional who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation
cooking act of preparing food for eating
it encompasses a vast range of methods tools and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavour or digestibility of food
it generally requires the selection measurement and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result
cuisine specific set of cooking traditions and practices often associated with a specific culture
it is often named after the region or place where its underlying culture is present
a cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade
baking the technique of prolonged cooking of food by dry heat acting by convection normally in an oven but can also be done in hot ashes or on hot stones
appliances like rotimatic also allow automatic baking
blindbaking baking pastry before adding a filling
boiling the rapid vaporization of a liquid which occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding environmental pressure
blanching cooking technique which food substance usually a vegetable or fruit is plunged into boiling water removed after a brief timed interval and finally plunged into iced water or placed under cold running water shocked to halt the cooking process
braising combination cooking method using both moist and dry heat typically the food is first seared at a high temperature and then finished in a covered pot with a variable amount of liquid resulting in a particular flavour
coddling food is heated in water kept just below the boiling point
infusion the process of soaking plant matter such as fruits or tea leaves in a liquid such as water or alcohol so as to impart flavor into the liquid
pressure cooking cooking in a sealed vessel that does not permit air or liquids to escape below a preset pressure which allows the liquid in the pot to rise to a higher temperature before boiling
simmering foods are cooked in hot liquids kept at or just below the boiling point of water but higher than poaching temperature
poaching process of gently simmering food in liquid generally milk stock or wine
steaming boiling water continuously so it vaporizes into steam and carries heat to the food being steamed thus cooking the food
double steaming chinese cooking technique in which food is covered with water and put in a covered ceramic jar and the jar is then steamed for several hours
steeping saturation of a food such as an herb in a liquid solvent to extract a soluble ingredient into the solvent
eg a cup of tea is made by steeping tea leaves in a cup of hot water
stewing food is cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy
vacuum flask cooking
grilling a form of cooking that involves dry heat applied to the surface of food commonly from above or below
barbecuing method of cooking meat poultry and occasionally fish with the heat and hot smoke of a fire smoking wood or hot coals of charcoal
frying cooking food in oil or another fat a technique that originated in ancient egypt around 2500 bc
deep frying food is submerged in hot oil or fat
this is normally performed with a deep fryer or chip pan
gentle frying
hot salt frying
pan frying cooking food in a pan using a small amount of cooking oil or fat as a heat transfer agent and to keep the food from sticking
pressure frying
sautéing
shallow frying
stir frying
microwave oven type of oven that heats foods quickly and efficiently using microwaves
however unlike conventional ovens a microwave oven does not brown bread or bake food
this makes microwave ovens unsuitable for cooking certain foods and unable to achieve certain culinary effects
additional kinds of heat sources can be added into microwave ovens or microwave packaging so as to add these additional effects
roasting cooking method that uses dry heat whether an open flame oven or other heat source
roasting usually causes caramelization or maillard browning of the surface of the food which is considered by some as a flavor enhancement
grilling applying dry heat to the surface of food by cooking it on a grill a grill pan or griddle
rotisserie meat is skewered on a spit a long solid rod used to hold food while it is being cooked over a fire in a fireplace or over a campfire or while being roasted in an oven
searing technique used in grilling baking braising roasting sautéing etc in which the surface of the food usually meat poultry or fish is cooked at high temperature so a caramelized crust forms
smoking the process of flavoring cooking or preserving food by exposing it to the smoke from burning or smoldering plant materials most often wood
hot smoking will cook and flavor the food while cold smoking only flavors the food
brining brining is a process similar to marination in which meat or poultry is soaked in brine before cooking
