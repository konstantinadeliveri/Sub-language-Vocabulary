each airline provides facilities for passengers to checkin their luggage except for their carryon bags
this may be by way of airlineemployed staff at checkin counters at airports or through an agency arrangement or by way of a selfservice kiosk
the luggage is weighed and tagged and then placed on a conveyor that usually feeds the luggage into the main baggage handling system

there is an increasing trend towards more streamlined checkingin processes whereby passengers can bypass or reduce the time in queues at the staffed checkin counters
this may involve passengers checking in online before arriving at the airport or using an airlines selfservice checkin kiosks at the airport
some airports have a curbside checkin where passengers can check in their bags to an airline representative before entering the terminal and then proceeding directly to security
many airlines have a deadline for passengers to check in before each flight
this is to allow the airline to offer unclaimed seats to standby passengers to load luggage onto the plane and to finalize documentation for takeoff
the passenger must also take into account the time that may be needed for them to clear the checkin line to pass security and then to walk sometimes also to ride from the checkin area to the boarding area

most hotels however allow a grace time typically 3060 minutes upon request by a guest without any additional charge if a guest wishes to have access to the room before the checkin time
some hotels also have a latest checkin time often 6 pm 8 pm after which they may give a room to someone else if the room has not been prepaid for or the guest does not phone in to indicate their expected time of arrival
some hotels have a deadline for checking in because the reception desk may close for the night
for the most costeffective usage of hotel room occupancy a guest should try to arrive near a hotels checkin time and leave or hand over the hotel room near the hotels checkout time

global tourism accounts for c 8 of global greenhousegas emissions
10 emissions as well as other significant environmental and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies
for this reason many tourist development organizations have begun to focus on sustainable tourism in order to mitigate negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism
the united nations world tourism organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the sustainable development goals through programs like the international year for sustainable tourism for development in 201711 and programs like tourism for sdgs focusing on how sdg 8 sdg 12 and sdg 14 implicate tourism in creating a sustainable economy

the economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets the cultural property and the nature of the travel location
the world heritage sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets
but even a countrys current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism
for example the fascination of the british royal family brings millions of tourists to great britain every year and thus the economy around 550 million a year
the habsburg family can be mentioned in central europe

modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the grand tour which was a traditional trip around europe especially germany and italy undertaken by mainly upperclass european young men of means mainly from western and northern european countries
in 1624 the young prince of poland ladislaus sigismund vasa the eldest son of sigismund iii embarked on a journey across europe as was in custom among polish nobility
41 he travelled through territories of todays germany belgium the netherlands where he admired the siege of breda by spanish forces france switzerland to italy austria and the czech republic
41 it was an educational journey42 and one of the outcomes was introduction of italian opera in the polish lithuanian commonwealth
43
the custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of largescale rail transit in the 1840s and generally followed a standard itinerary
it was an educational opportunity and rite of passage
though primarily associated with the british nobility and wealthy landed gentry similar trips were made by wealthy young men of protestant northern european nations on the continent and from the second half of the 18th century some south american us and other overseas youth joined in
the tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier and thomas cook made the cooks tour a byword
the grand tour became a real status symbol for upperclass students in the 18th and 19th centuries
in this period johann joachim winckelmanns theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the european academic world
artists writers and travellers such as goethe affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which italy france and greece provide excellent examples
for these reasons the grand tours main destinations were to those centers where upperclass students could find rare examples of classic art and history
the new york times recently described the grand tour in this way
three hundred years ago wealthy young englishmen began taking a postoxbridge trek through france and italy in search of art culture and the roots of western civilization
with nearly unlimited funds aristocratic connections and months or years to roam they commissioned paintings perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the continentthe primary value of the grand tour it was believed laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the renaissance and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the european continent
leisure travel was associated with the industrial revolution in the united kingdom the first european country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population
44 initially this applied to the owners of the machinery of production the economic oligarchy factory owners and traders
these comprised the new middle class
44 cox kings was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758
45
the british origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names
in nice france one of the first and bestestablished holiday resorts on the french riviera the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the promenade des anglais in many other historic resorts in continental europe old wellestablished palace hotels have names like the hotel bristol hotel carlton or hotel majestic reflecting the dominance of english customers
a pioneer of the travel agency business thomas cooks idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the london road at kibworth
with the opening of the extended midland counties railway he arranged to take a group of 540 temperance campaigners from leicester campbell street station to a rally in loughborough eleven miles 18 km away
on 5 july 1841 thomas cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person this included rail tickets and food for the journey
cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers as the railway tickets being legal contracts between company and passenger could not have been issued at his own price
clarification needed this was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous unadvertised private excursion trains
46 during the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and sunday school children
in 1844 the midland counties railway company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him provided he found the passengers
this success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure taking a percentage of the railway fares
47
in 1855 he planned his first excursion abroad when he took a group from leicester to calais to coincide with the paris exhibition
the following year he started his grand circular tours of europe
48 during the 1860s he took parties to switzerland italy egypt and the united states
cook established inclusive independent travel whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route
such was his success that the scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves
the tourism industry as part of the service sector49 has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries
the manila declaration on world tourism of 1980 recognized its importance as an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social cultural educational and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations
350
tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists accounting as of 2011update for 30 of the worlds trade in services and as an invisible export for 6 of overall exports of goods and services
7 it also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism
51 it is also claimed that travel broadens the mind
5253
the hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services such as airlines cruise ships transits trains and taxicabs lodging including hotels hostels homestays resorts and renting out rooms and entertainment venues such as amusement parks restaurants casinos festivals shopping malls music venues and theatres
this is in addition to goods bought by tourists including souvenirs
on the flipside tourism can degrade people54
and sour relationships between host and guest

the economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets the cultural property and the nature of the travel location

cultural and natural heritage are in many cases the absolute basis for worldwide tourism
cultural tourism is one of the megatrends that is reflected in massive numbers of overnight stays and sales
as unesco is increasingly observing the cultural heritage is needed for tourism but also endangered by it
the icomos international cultural tourism charter from 1999 is already dealing with all of these problems
as a result of the tourist hazard for example the lascaux cave was rebuilt for tourists
overtourism is an important buzzword in this area
furthermore the focus of unesco in war zones is to ensure the protection of cultural heritage in order to maintain this future important economic basis for the local population
and there is intensive cooperation between unesco the united nations the united nations peacekeeping and blue shield international
there are extensive international and national considerations studies and programs to protect cultural assets from the effects of tourism and those from war
in particular it is also about training civilian and military personnel
but the involvement of the locals is particularly important
the founding president of blue shield international karl von habsburg summed it up with the words without the local community and without the local participants that would be completely impossible

coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter
academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on prescheduled tours usually under the organization of tourism professionals
64 this form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the united kingdom and was pioneered by thomas cook
cook took advantage of europes rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to the masses in addition to longer holidays to continental europe india asia and the western hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers
by the 1890s over 20000 tourists per year used thomas cook son
65
the relationship between tourism companies transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism
cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads
65 one contemporary form of mass tourism package tourism still incorporates the partnership between these three groups
travel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes
improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time
in continental europe early seaside resorts included heiligendamm founded in 1793 at the baltic sea being the first seaside resort ostend popularised by the people of brussels boulognesurmer and deauville for the parisians taormina in sicily
in the united states the first seaside resorts in the european style were at atlantic city new jersey and long island new york

niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years each with its own adjective

st moritz switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s hotel manager johannes badrutt invited some summer guests from england to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape thereby inaugurating a popular trend
6869 it was however only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the swiss ski resorts
even in winter up to one third of all guests depending on the location consist of nonskiers
70
major ski resorts are located mostly in the various european countries eg
andorra austria bulgaria bosniaherzegovina croatia czech republic cyprus finland france germany greece iceland italy norway latvia lithuania poland romania serbia sweden slovakia slovenia spain switzerland turkey canada the united states eg
montana utah colorado california wyoming vermont new hampshire new york argentina new zealand japan south korea chile and lebanon
there has been an uptrend in tourism over the last few decadesvague especially in europe where international travel for short breaks is common
tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them
for example some people prefer simple beach vacations while others want more specialized holidays quieter resorts familyoriented holidays or niche markettargeted destination hotels
the developments in air transport infrastructure such as jumbo jets lowcost airlines and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable
a major factor in the relatively low cost of air travel is the tax exemption for aviation fuels
the who estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time
71 there have also been changes in lifestyle for example some retirementage people sustain yearround tourism
this is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services
some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailormade package requested by the customer upon impulse
there have been a few setbacks in tourism such as the september 11 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as in bali and several european cities
also on 26 december 2004 a tsunami caused by the 2004 indian ocean earthquake hit the asian countries on the indian ocean including the maldives
thousands of lives were lost including many tourists
this together with the vast cleanup operations stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time
72
individual lowprice or even zeroprice overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like couchsurfing and airbnb being established
73 there has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of gdp is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism as has occurred for instance in dubai
74
sustainable tourism is a concept that covers the complete tourism experience including concern for economic social and environmental issues as well as attention to improving tourists experiences and addressing the needs of host communities
75 sustainable tourism emerged as an outcome of preventing the uncontrolled and excessive use of mountain tourism resources and attractions in sumadija and western serbia
sustainable tourism should embrace concerns for environmental protection social equity and the quality of life cultural diversity and a dynamic viable economy delivering jobs and prosperity for all
76
ecotourism also known as ecological tourism is responsible travel to fragile pristine and usually protected areas that strives to be lowimpact and often smallscale
it helps educate the traveller provides funds for conservation directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights
take only memories and leave only footprints is a very common slogan in protected areas
81 tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior
82
volunteer tourism or voluntourism is growing as a largely western phenomenon with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities
wearing 2001 defines volunteer tourism as applying to those tourists who for various reasons volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society
83 vso was founded in the uk in 1958 and the us peace corps was subsequently founded in 1960
these were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism
84
this form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism
85 however increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour and force unwilling host communities to adopt western initiatives86 while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist
87 increasingly organisations such as vso have been concerned with communitycentric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people
88
propoor tourism which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development the issue has been addressed through smallscale projects in local communities and through attempts by ministries of tourism to attract large numbers of tourists
89 research by the overseas development institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists money to reach the poorest as only 25 or less far less in some cases ever reaches the poor successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountainclimbing in tanzania and cultural tourism in luang prabang laos
90 there is also the possibility of propoor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world
91
recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis
recession tourism is defined by lowcost and highvalue experiences taking place at oncepopular generic retreats
various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travellers are elongating trips where their money travels further
this concept is not widely used in tourism research
it is related to the shortlived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation
when there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure particularly in southeast asia india sri lanka eastern europe cuba92 and canada93 where there are different regulatory regimes in relation to particular medical procedures eg

educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of the classroom environment
brent w ritchie publisher of managing educational tourism created a study of a geographic subdivision to demonstrate how tourism educated high school students participating in foreign exchange programs over the last 15 years
94 in educational tourism the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture study tours or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment such as in the international practicum training program
95 in 2018 one impact was many exchange students traveled to america to assist students financially in order to maintain their secondary education
96
this type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the cityregion
97 this type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience
creating a sustainable atmosphere creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices
an example of event tourism would be the music festival south by southwest that is hosted in austin texas annually
every year people from all over the world flock to the city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see bands perform
people are drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which defines event tourism
creative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism since the early beginnings of tourism itself
its european roots date back to the time of the grand tour which saw the sons of aristocratic families travelling for the purpose of mostly interactive educational experiences
more recently creative tourism has been given its own name by crispin raymond and greg richards98 who as members of the association for tourism and leisure education atlas have directed a number of projects for the european commission including cultural and crafts tourism known as sustainable tourism
they have defined creative tourism as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences
98
meanwhile the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by highprofile organizations such as unesco who through the creative cities network have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place
unesco wrote in one of its documents creative tourism involves more interaction in which the visitor has an educational emotional social and participative interaction with the place its living culture and the people who live there
they feel like a citizen
99 saying so the tourist will have the opportunity to take part in workshops classes and activities related to the culture of the destination
more recently creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism drawing on active participation by travellers in the culture of the host communities they visit
several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development including the united kingdom austria france the bahamas jamaica spain italy new zealand and south korea
100101
the growing interest of tourists102 in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism highlighting the intangible heritage craft workshops cooking classes etc
and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure for example through the rent of halls and auditoriums
experiential travel or immersion travel is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry
it is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country city or particular place by connecting to its history people food and culture
103
the term experiential travel has been mentioned in publications since 1985104 but it was not discovered as a meaningful market trend until much later
one emerging area of special interest has been identified by lennon and foley 2000105106 as dark tourism
this type of tourism involves visits to dark sites such as battlegrounds scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide for example concentration camps
its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs
107
philip stone argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining ones own death through the real death of others
108 erik h cohen introduces the term populo sites to evidence the educational character of dark tourism
popular sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors
based on a study at yad vashem the shoah holocaust memorial museum in jerusalem a new term in populo is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell
learning about the shoah in jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in europe but equally authentic
it is argued that a dichotomy between authentic sites at the location of a tragedy and created sites elsewhere is insufficient
participants evaluations of seminars for european teachers at yad vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject
implications for other cases of dark tourism at in populo locations are discussed
109 in this vein peter tarlow defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths which continue to impact our lives
this issue can not be understood without the figure of trauma
110
victoria mitchell et al
suggest that dark tourism seems to be a heterogeneous discipline
there is a great dispersion of definitions knowledge production and meanings revolving around the term
in fact dark tourism practices vary in culture and time
qualitative speaking dark tourism experience is pretty different from leisure practices
to fill the gap the existent definitions should be catalogued in subcategories to form an allencompassing model that expands the current understanding of dark tourism
111 in consonance with this m apleni et al
argue dark tourism helps the industry not to be fragmented before the ongoing states of crises the activity often faces
they cite the case of terrorism which paves the way for the construction of a new dark site
dark tourism plays a leading role not only in enhancing destination resilience but also in helping communities to deal with traumatic experiences
112
social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation
it includes youth hostels and lowpriced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations trade unions or in communist times publicly owned enterprises
in may 1959 at the second congress of social tourism in austria walter hunziker proposed the following definition social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by lowincome groups and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services
113
also known as tourism of doom or last chance tourism this emerging trend involves travelling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened such as the ice caps of mount kilimanjaro the melting glaciers of patagonia or the coral of the great barrier reef before it is too late
identified by travel trade magazine travel age west114 editorinchief kenneth shapiro in 2007 and later explored in the new york times115 this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise
some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming overpopulation or climate change
others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individuals carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing

religious tourism in particular pilgrimage can serve to strengthen faith and to demonstrate devotion both of which are central tenets of many major religions
121need quotation to verify religious tourists may seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their selfidentity in a positive manner
given this the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious selfidentity or not
122
dna tourism also called ancestry tourism or heritage travel is tourism based on dna testing
these tourists visit their remote relatives or places where their ancestors came from or where their relatives reside based on the results of dna tests
dna testing became a growing trend in 2019

tourism brings both positive and negative impacts on tourist destinations
the traditionallydescribed domains of tourism impacts are economic sociocultural and environmental dimensions
125126 the economic effects of tourism include improved tax revenue and personal income increased standards of living and more employment opportunities
127128 sociocultural impacts are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds attitudes and behaviors and relationships to material goods
129 environmental impacts can have both direct effects including degradation of habitat vegetation air quality bodies of water the water table wildlife and changes in natural phenomena and indirect effects such as increased harvesting of natural resources to supply food indirect air and water pollution including from flights transport and the manufacture of food and souvenirs for tourists
excessive hordes of visitors or of the wrong sort of visitors can provoke backlashes from otherwise friendly hosts in popular destinations
133
negative environmental consequences related to tourism activities such as greenhouse gas emissions from air travel and litter at popular locations can be significant
134
tourism is sometimes associated with export or theft of contraband such as endangered species or certain cultural artifacts and illegal sex trade activities
135136
in recent yearswhen
the local population in many areas has developed antitourism sentiment and begun to protest against tourists
one of the most prominent examples of such a mobilization was the socalled tourists go home movement which emerged in 2014 in spain due to slogans and mottos calling the tourists to go back to their homes
137 venice also faced such problems and the tourists go home slogans appeared on the walls of the city
138 moreover several other countries such as japan and the philippines are having problems with overtourism
139140
the year 2017 seems to be a landmark for antitourism sentiment as a new spanish social movement against an economic development model based on mass tourism gained following highprofile attacks targeting foreign tourists and local business interests
141 antitourism sentiment also seems to be linked to a clash of identity and peoples individualism
142
the world tourism organization unwto forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4
143 with the advent of ecommerce tourism products have become prominent traded items on the internet
144145 tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries although tourism providers hotels airlines etc
including smallscale operators can sell their services directly
146147 this has put pressure on intermediaries from both online and traditional shops
it has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context
148 not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies
this is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future
there has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism with only the russian space agency providing transport to date
a 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billiondollar market by 2030
149150
since the late 1980s sports tourism has become increasingly popular
events such as rugby olympics commonwealth games and fifa world cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights hotels and excursions
tourism security is a subdiscipline of tourist studies that explores the factors that affect the ontological security of tourists
risks are evaluated by their impact and nature
151 tourism security includes methodologies theories and techniques oriented to protect the organic image of tourist destinations
152 three academic waves are significant in tourism security risk perception theory disaster management and postdisaster consumption
153
andrew spencer peter tarlow argue that tourism security is not an easy concept to define
it includes a set of subdisciplines and global risks different in nature which cause different effects in the tourism industry
the rise of tourism security and safety as a consolidated discipline coincides with the globalization and ultimate maturation of the industry worldwide
some threats include for example terrorist groups looking to destabilize governments affecting not only the local economies but killing foreign tourists to cause geopolitical tensions between deliverycountry and receivingtourist countries
today island destinations are more affected by terrorism and other global risks than other continent destinations 154 155
as a result of the late2000s recession international arrivals experienced a strong slowdown beginning in june 2008
growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 37 during the first eight months of 2008
this slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry with negative growth in september 2008 and a 33 growth in passenger traffic through september
the hotel industry also reported a slowdown with room occupancy declining
in 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 38
156 by the first quarter of 2009 real travel demand in the united states had fallen 6 over six quarters
while this is considerably milder than what occurred after the 911 attacks the decline was at twice the rate as real gdp has fallen
157158
in 2020 the covid19 pandemic lockdowns travel bans and a substantial reduction in passenger travel by air and sea contributed to a sharp decline in tourism activity
159
however evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term
160 manyquantify people increasingly view vacations and travel as a necessity rather than a luxury and this is reflected in tourist numbers recoveringwhen
some 66 globally over 2009 with growth up to 8 in emerging economies

a receptionist may ask visitors who they are to meet and may ask them to sign a register
the receptionist may give a visitor instructions as to where to go or inform the host that his guest has arrived
the visitor may be issued with a visible visitor s pass often worn around the neck
however research shows that long waiting times at the reception area could lead to loss of customers
1
covid19 has lead organisations to wider and faster adoption of technology to streamline the visitor checkin process2 visitor management systems automate the visitor check in process and reduces office checkin time with preregistering visitors through email effective communication qr code express checkin automate host notifications and efficient visitor management workflows
the checkin process at airports enables passengers to checkin luggage onto a plane and to obtain a boarding pass
when presenting at the checkin counter a passenger will provide evidence of the right to travel such as a ticket visa or electronic means
each airline provides facilities for passengers to checkin their luggage except for their carryon bags
this may be by way of airlineemployed staff at checkin counters at airports or through an agency arrangement or by way of a selfservice kiosk
the luggage is weighed and tagged and then placed on a conveyor that usually feeds the luggage into the main baggage handling system
the luggage goes into the aircrafts cargo hold
the checkin staff then issues each passenger with a boarding pass
there is an increasing trend towards more streamlined checkingin processes whereby passengers can bypass or reduce the time in queues at the staffed checkin counters
this may involve passengers checking in online before arriving at the airport or using an airlines selfservice checkin kiosks at the airport
some airports have a curbside checkin where passengers can check in their bags to an airline representative before entering the terminal and then proceeding directly to security
many airlines have a deadline for passengers to check in before each flight
this is to allow the airline to offer unclaimed seats to standby passengers to load luggage onto the plane and to finalize documentation for takeoff
the passenger must also take into account the time that may be needed for them to clear the checkin line to pass security and then to walk sometimes also to ride from the checkin area to the boarding area
this may take several hours at some airports or at some times of the year
on international flights additional time would be required for immigration and customs clearance
hotels and similar establishments usually require guests to check in also called registering or signing in which involves the guest providing or confirming personal information including contact information along with a signature
the laws of some countries require guests to provide this information and to sign a register often called a hotel register or guestbook which may be in the form of a registration card345 and some also require the provision of identification documents such as a passport or drivers licence which the hotel may wish to copy and retain in its records
usually only one guest is required to register per room
sometimes the register may need to be provided to a government agency such as the local police and sometimes with a court warrant or similar authority
6
the establishment may require guests to provide a credit card or a security deposit as a guarantee to cover potential costs such as the use of room service or a minibar for the duration of the stay and to facilitate a more expedient checkout process at the end of the guests stay
at the end of the checking in process the reception staff will provide guests with a room key
more and more hotels are implementing an online or contactless checkin options
checkin times vary but can range from about 12 pm to about 3 pm depending on the establishments rules and regulations
late checkins can be arranged through the hotel as long as the guests book this in advance and arrange all the necessary details
hotels usually specify a checkin time after which they expect guests to check in
if a guest wants to occupy a hotel room before the hotels checkin time some hotels may charge for an additional day or treat it as a previous days stay as compared to occupying the hotel room after the checkin time
most hotels however allow a grace time typically 3060 minutes upon request by a guest without any additional charge if a guest wishes to have access to the room before the checkin time
some hotels also have a latest checkin time often 6 pm 8 pm after which they may give a room to someone else if the room has not been prepaid for or the guest does not phone in to indicate their expected time of arrival
some hotels have a deadline for checking in because the reception desk may close for the night
for the most costeffective usage of hotel room occupancy a guest should try to arrive near a hotels checkin time and leave or hand over the hotel room near the hotels checkout time
however doing so may not always be practical because for example a guests flight arrival and departure times or car trips may not align with a hotels checkin and checkout times
many social networking services such as foursquare google facebook jiepang vk and getglue as well as gowalla closed google latitude closed and brightkite closed in the past allow users to what has been referred to as selfreported positioning78 or more commonly known as a checkin to a physical place and share their locations with their friends
9
users can check in to a specific location by text messaging or by using a mobile application on a smartphone the application will use the phones gps to find the current location
many applications have a places button or tab where a user can see a list of nearby places into which the user can check in
if a location is not on the nearby places list the user can add the location directly from the phone
once users have checked in they have the option of sharing their location with friends in services such as twitter or facebook
since the checkin became a ubiquitous mechanism in most mobile applications the industry especially in the gaming branch has tried to find alternatives
clarification needed gaming applications in particular require the user to check in multiple times in a row so the mechanism becomes a sustained routine
example needed currently possibilities for an autocheckin are being tested by developers

a maid or housemaid or maidservant is a female domestic worker
in the victorian era domestic service was the second largest category of employment in england and wales after agricultural work
1 in developed western nations fulltime maids are now only found in the wealthiest households
in other parts of the world maids remain common in urban middleclass households
maid in middle english meant an unmarried woman especially a young one or specifically a virgin
these meanings lived on in english until recent times and are still familiar from literature and folk music alongside the sense of the word as a type of servant
23
in the contemporary western world comparatively few households can afford livein domestic help usually relying on cleaners employed directly or through an agency maid service
today a single maid may be the only domestic worker that uppermiddle class households employ as was historically the case
in less developed nations various factors ensure a labour source for domestic work very large differences in the income of urban and rural households widespread poverty fewer educated women and limited opportunities for the employment of less educated women
maids perform typical domestic chores such as laundry ironing cleaning the house grocery shopping cooking and caring for household pets
they may also take care of children although there are more specific occupations for this such as nanny
in some poor countries maids take care of the elderly and people with disabilities
many maids are required by their employers to wear a uniform
legislation in many countries makes certain living conditions working hours or minimum wage a requirement of domestic service
nonetheless the work of a maid has always been hard involving a full day and extensive duties
citation needed
maids were once part of an elaborate hierarchy in great houses where the retinue of servants stretched up to the housekeeper and butler responsible for female and male employees respectively
the word maid itself means an unmarried young woman or virgin
domestic workers particularly those low in the hierarchy such as maids and footmen were expected to remain unmarried while in service45 and even highestranking workers such as butlers could be dismissed for marrying

in some areas in the region the word maid is avoided
this is most likely due to the fact that it sounds like a racially derogatory term in afrikaans
the afrikaans word for a mite small arachnid has been used demeaningly to refer to woman of colour
the english word for a friend mate is also avoided for this reason
maids traditionally have a fixed position in the hierarchy of the large households and although there is overlap between definitions dependent on the size of the household the positions themselves would typically be rigidly adhered to
the usual classifications of maid in a large household are
in more modest households a single maidofallwork or skivvy was often the only staff
it is possible this word originates from the italian for slave schiavo owned person
one of the most indepth and enduring representations of the lives of several types of maid was seen in the 1970s television drama upstairs downstairs set in england between 1903 and 1936

some smalltomediumsized business owners hire a live remote receptionist in lieu of a fulltime inhouse receptionist thanks to advances in communications technology
10 as the phrase itself suggests a live remote receptionist deals with phone calls for a company in another location using telephony private branch exchange pbx servers
most modern receptionist services can take messages screen and forward calls answer basic faqs and fill out web forms
many services can also schedule appointments and take credit card orders
some of the older receptionist services have been around for decades but these often operate very differently from modern services
11
advances in touch screen and 2way video technology is changing the way some receptionist work
new types of virtual video receptionist systems now allows for live inhouse or remote receptionists to manage office lobby areas from remote locations
these virtual receptionists not only answer phones but also greet walkin visitors by utilizing a motion detection camera to see visitors as they enter the building
the remote receptionist is then displayed in a video window on a wallmounted lcd kiosk or desktop allinone computer
the video receptionist and visitors can then communicate via 2way video allowing the receptionist to manage one or many office lobby areas from a central location
the advancement of office automation has eliminated some receptionists jobs
for example a telephone call could be answered by an automated attendant
however a receptionist who possesses strong officetechnical skills and who is also adept in courtesy tact and diplomacy is still considered an asset to a companys business image and is still very much in demand in the business world

3 tourism can be domestic within the travellers own country or international and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a countrys balance of payments
tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown the late2000s recession between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009 and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 h1n1 influenza virus45 but slowly recovered until the covid19 pandemic put an abrupt end to the growth
the united nations world tourism organization estimated that global international tourist arrivals might decrease by 58 to 78 in 2020 leading to a potential loss of us 09 12 trillion in international tourism receipts
6
globally international tourism receipts the travel item in balance of payments grew to us103 trillion 740 billion in 2005 corresponding to an increase in real terms of 38 from 2010
7 international tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 20128 emerging source markets such as china russia and brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade
9
global tourism accounts for c 8 of global greenhousegas emissions
10 emissions as well as other significant environmental and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies
for this reason many tourist development organizations have begun to focus on sustainable tourism in order to mitigate negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism
the united nations world tourism organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the sustainable development goals through programs like the international year for sustainable tourism for development in 201711 and programs like tourism for sdgs focusing on how sdg 8 sdg 12 and sdg 14 implicate tourism in creating a sustainable economy

16in 1936 the league of nations defined a foreign tourist as someone traveling abroad for at least twentyfour hours
its successor the united nations amended this definition in 1945 by including a maximum stay of six months
18
in 1941 hunziker and kraft defined tourism as the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of nonresidents insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity
1920 in 1976 the tourism society of englands definition was tourism is the temporary shortterm movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination
it includes movements for all purposes

22
in 1994 the united nations identified three forms of tourism in its recommendations on tourism statistics23
other groupings derived from the above grouping25
the terms tourism and travel are sometimes used interchangeably
in this context travel has a similar definition to tourism but implies a more purposeful journey
the terms tourism and tourist are sometimes used pejoratively to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited
by contrast traveller is often used as a sign of distinction

according to the world tourism organization a tourism product is27
a combination of tangible and intangible elements such as natural cultural and manmade resources attractions facilities services and activities around a specific center of interest which represents the core of the destination marketing mix and creates an overall visitor experience including emotional aspects for the potential customers

31 in 2010 there were over 940 million international tourist arrivals worldwide
32 by 2016 that number had risen to 1235 million producing 1220 billion usd in destination spending
33 the covid19 crisis had significant negative effects on international tourism significantly slowing the overall increasing trend
the economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets the cultural property and the nature of the travel location
the world heritage sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets
but even a countrys current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism
for example the fascination of the british royal family brings millions of tourists to great britain every year and thus the economy around 550 million a year
the habsburg family can be mentioned in central europe
according to estimates the habsburg brand should generate tourism sales of 60 million euros per year for vienna alone
the tourist principle habsburg sells applies
3435
tourism typically requires the tourist to feel engaged in a genuine experience of the location they are visiting
according to dean maccannell tourism requires that the tourist can view the toured area as both authentic and different from their own lived experience
36 113 better source needed by viewing the exotic tourists learn what they themselves are not that is they are unexotic or normal
36better source needed
according to maccannell all modern tourism experiences the authentic and exotic as developmentally inferior to the modern that is to the lived experience of the tourist
36 114 better source needed
travel outside a persons local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes who at times travelled to distant parts of the world to see great buildings and works of art learn new languages experience new cultures enjoy pristine nature and to taste different cuisines
as early as shulgi however kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travellers
37 travelling for pleasure can be seen in egypt as early on as 1500 bc
38 during the roman republic spas and coastal resorts such as baiae were popular among the rich
the roman upper class used to spend their free time on land or at sea and travelled to their villa urbana or villa maritima
numerous villas were located in campania around rome and in the northern part of the adriatic as in barcola near trieste
pausanias wrote his description of greece in the second century ad
in ancient china nobles sometimes made a point of visiting mount tai and on occasion all five sacred mountains
by the middle ages christianity and buddhism and islam had traditions of pilgrimage
chaucers canterbury tales and wu chengens journey to the west remain classics of english and chinese literature
the 10th to 13thcentury song dynasty also saw secular travel writers such as su shi 11th century and fan chengda 12th century become popular in china
under the ming xu xiake continued the practice
39 in medieval italy francesco petrarch also wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of mount ventoux that praised the act of travelling and criticized frigida incuriositas cold lack of curiosity
the burgundian poet michault taillevent fr later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the jura mountains
40
modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the grand tour which was a traditional trip around europe especially germany and italy undertaken by mainly upperclass european young men of means mainly from western and northern european countries
in 1624 the young prince of poland ladislaus sigismund vasa the eldest son of sigismund iii embarked on a journey across europe as was in custom among polish nobility
41 he travelled through territories of todays germany belgium the netherlands where he admired the siege of breda by spanish forces france switzerland to italy austria and the czech republic
41 it was an educational journey42 and one of the outcomes was introduction of italian opera in the polish lithuanian commonwealth
43
the custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of largescale rail transit in the 1840s and generally followed a standard itinerary
it was an educational opportunity and rite of passage
though primarily associated with the british nobility and wealthy landed gentry similar trips were made by wealthy young men of protestant northern european nations on the continent and from the second half of the 18th century some south american us and other overseas youth joined in
the tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier and thomas cook made the cooks tour a byword
the grand tour became a real status symbol for upperclass students in the 18th and 19th centuries
in this period johann joachim winckelmanns theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the european academic world
artists writers and travellers such as goethe affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which italy france and greece provide excellent examples
for these reasons the grand tours main destinations were to those centers where upperclass students could find rare examples of classic art and history
the new york times recently described the grand tour in this way
three hundred years ago wealthy young englishmen began taking a postoxbridge trek through france and italy in search of art culture and the roots of western civilization
with nearly unlimited funds aristocratic connections and months or years to roam they commissioned paintings perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the continentthe primary value of the grand tour it was believed laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the renaissance and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the european continent
leisure travel was associated with the industrial revolution in the united kingdom the first european country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population
44 initially this applied to the owners of the machinery of production the economic oligarchy factory owners and traders
these comprised the new middle class
44 cox kings was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758
45
the british origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names
in nice france one of the first and bestestablished holiday resorts on the french riviera the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the promenade des anglais in many other historic resorts in continental europe old wellestablished palace hotels have names like the hotel bristol hotel carlton or hotel majestic reflecting the dominance of english customers
a pioneer of the travel agency business thomas cooks idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the london road at kibworth
with the opening of the extended midland counties railway he arranged to take a group of 540 temperance campaigners from leicester campbell street station to a rally in loughborough eleven miles 18 km away
on 5 july 1841 thomas cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person this included rail tickets and food for the journey
cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers as the railway tickets being legal contracts between company and passenger could not have been issued at his own price
clarification needed this was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous unadvertised private excursion trains
46 during the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and sunday school children
in 1844 the midland counties railway company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him provided he found the passengers
this success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure taking a percentage of the railway fares
47
in 1855 he planned his first excursion abroad when he took a group from leicester to calais to coincide with the paris exhibition
the following year he started his grand circular tours of europe
48 during the 1860s he took parties to switzerland italy egypt and the united states
cook established inclusive independent travel whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route
such was his success that the scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves
the tourism industry as part of the service sector49 has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries
the manila declaration on world tourism of 1980 recognized its importance as an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social cultural educational and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations
350
tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists accounting as of 2011update for 30 of the worlds trade in services and as an invisible export for 6 of overall exports of goods and services
7 it also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism
51 it is also claimed that travel broadens the mind
5253
the hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services such as airlines cruise ships transits trains and taxicabs lodging including hotels hostels homestays resorts and renting out rooms and entertainment venues such as amusement parks restaurants casinos festivals shopping malls music venues and theatres
this is in addition to goods bought by tourists including souvenirs
on the flipside tourism can degrade people54
and sour relationships between host and guest
55
the economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets the cultural property and the nature of the travel location
the world heritage sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets
but even a countrys current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism
for example the fascination of the british royal family brings millions of tourists to great britain every year and thus the economy around 550 million a year
the habsburg family can be mentioned in central europe
according to estimates the habsburg brand should generate tourism sales of 60 million euros per year for vienna alone
the tourist principle habsburg sells applies
5657
cultural and natural heritage are in many cases the absolute basis for worldwide tourism
cultural tourism is one of the megatrends that is reflected in massive numbers of overnight stays and sales
as unesco is increasingly observing the cultural heritage is needed for tourism but also endangered by it
the icomos international cultural tourism charter from 1999 is already dealing with all of these problems
as a result of the tourist hazard for example the lascaux cave was rebuilt for tourists
overtourism is an important buzzword in this area
furthermore the focus of unesco in war zones is to ensure the protection of cultural heritage in order to maintain this future important economic basis for the local population
and there is intensive cooperation between unesco the united nations the united nations peacekeeping and blue shield international
there are extensive international and national considerations studies and programs to protect cultural assets from the effects of tourism and those from war
in particular it is also about training civilian and military personnel
but the involvement of the locals is particularly important
the founding president of blue shield international karl von habsburg summed it up with the words without the local community and without the local participants that would be completely impossible
58596061
cruising is a popular form of water tourism
leisure cruise ships were introduced by the peninsular oriental steam navigation company po in 1844 sailing from southampton to destinations such as gibraltar malta and athens
62 in 1891 german businessman albert ballin sailed the ship augusta victoria from hamburg into the mediterranean sea
29 june 1900 saw the launching of the first purposebuilt cruise ship was prinzessin victoria luise built in hamburg for the hamburg america line
63
many leisureoriented tourists travel to seaside resorts on their nearest coast or further afield
coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter
academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on prescheduled tours usually under the organization of tourism professionals
64 this form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the united kingdom and was pioneered by thomas cook
cook took advantage of europes rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to the masses in addition to longer holidays to continental europe india asia and the western hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers
by the 1890s over 20000 tourists per year used thomas cook son
65
the relationship between tourism companies transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism
cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads
65 one contemporary form of mass tourism package tourism still incorporates the partnership between these three groups
travel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes
improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time
in continental europe early seaside resorts included heiligendamm founded in 1793 at the baltic sea being the first seaside resort ostend popularised by the people of brussels boulognesurmer and deauville for the parisians taormina in sicily
in the united states the first seaside resorts in the european style were at atlantic city new jersey and long island new york
by the mid20th century the mediterranean coast became the principal mass tourism destination
the 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the spanish economic miracle
niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years each with its own adjective
many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics
66 others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage
examples of the more common niche tourism markets are
other terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term destination in the descriptions such as destination weddings and terms such as location vacation
st moritz switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s hotel manager johannes badrutt invited some summer guests from england to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape thereby inaugurating a popular trend
6869 it was however only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the swiss ski resorts
even in winter up to one third of all guests depending on the location consist of nonskiers
70
major ski resorts are located mostly in the various european countries eg
andorra austria bulgaria bosniaherzegovina croatia czech republic cyprus finland france germany greece iceland italy norway latvia lithuania poland romania serbia sweden slovakia slovenia spain switzerland turkey canada the united states eg
montana utah colorado california wyoming vermont new hampshire new york argentina new zealand japan south korea chile and lebanon
there has been an uptrend in tourism over the last few decadesvague especially in europe where international travel for short breaks is common
tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them
for example some people prefer simple beach vacations while others want more specialized holidays quieter resorts familyoriented holidays or niche markettargeted destination hotels
the developments in air transport infrastructure such as jumbo jets lowcost airlines and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable
a major factor in the relatively low cost of air travel is the tax exemption for aviation fuels
the who estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time
71 there have also been changes in lifestyle for example some retirementage people sustain yearround tourism
this is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services
some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailormade package requested by the customer upon impulse
there have been a few setbacks in tourism such as the september 11 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as in bali and several european cities
also on 26 december 2004 a tsunami caused by the 2004 indian ocean earthquake hit the asian countries on the indian ocean including the maldives
thousands of lives were lost including many tourists
this together with the vast cleanup operations stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time
72
individual lowprice or even zeroprice overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like couchsurfing and airbnb being established
73 there has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of gdp is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism as has occurred for instance in dubai
74
sustainable tourism is a concept that covers the complete tourism experience including concern for economic social and environmental issues as well as attention to improving tourists experiences and addressing the needs of host communities
75 sustainable tourism emerged as an outcome of preventing the uncontrolled and excessive use of mountain tourism resources and attractions in sumadija and western serbia
sustainable tourism should embrace concerns for environmental protection social equity and the quality of life cultural diversity and a dynamic viable economy delivering jobs and prosperity for all
76
ecotourism also known as ecological tourism is responsible travel to fragile pristine and usually protected areas that strives to be lowimpact and often smallscale
it helps educate the traveller provides funds for conservation directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights
take only memories and leave only footprints is a very common slogan in protected areas
81 tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior
82
volunteer tourism or voluntourism is growing as a largely western phenomenon with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities
wearing 2001 defines volunteer tourism as applying to those tourists who for various reasons volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society
83 vso was founded in the uk in 1958 and the us peace corps was subsequently founded in 1960
these were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism
84
this form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism
85 however increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour and force unwilling host communities to adopt western initiatives86 while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist
87 increasingly organisations such as vso have been concerned with communitycentric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people
88
propoor tourism which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development the issue has been addressed through smallscale projects in local communities and through attempts by ministries of tourism to attract large numbers of tourists
89 research by the overseas development institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists money to reach the poorest as only 25 or less far less in some cases ever reaches the poor successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountainclimbing in tanzania and cultural tourism in luang prabang laos
90 there is also the possibility of propoor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world
91
recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis
recession tourism is defined by lowcost and highvalue experiences taking place at oncepopular generic retreats
various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travellers are elongating trips where their money travels further
this concept is not widely used in tourism research
it is related to the shortlived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation
when there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure particularly in southeast asia india sri lanka eastern europe cuba92 and canada93 where there are different regulatory regimes in relation to particular medical procedures eg
dentistry travelling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as medical tourism
educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of the classroom environment
brent w ritchie publisher of managing educational tourism created a study of a geographic subdivision to demonstrate how tourism educated high school students participating in foreign exchange programs over the last 15 years
94 in educational tourism the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture study tours or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment such as in the international practicum training program
95 in 2018 one impact was many exchange students traveled to america to assist students financially in order to maintain their secondary education
96
this type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the cityregion
97 this type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience
creating a sustainable atmosphere creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices
an example of event tourism would be the music festival south by southwest that is hosted in austin texas annually
every year people from all over the world flock to the city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see bands perform
people are drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which defines event tourism
creative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism since the early beginnings of tourism itself
its european roots date back to the time of the grand tour which saw the sons of aristocratic families travelling for the purpose of mostly interactive educational experiences
more recently creative tourism has been given its own name by crispin raymond and greg richards98 who as members of the association for tourism and leisure education atlas have directed a number of projects for the european commission including cultural and crafts tourism known as sustainable tourism
they have defined creative tourism as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences
98
meanwhile the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by highprofile organizations such as unesco who through the creative cities network have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place
unesco wrote in one of its documents creative tourism involves more interaction in which the visitor has an educational emotional social and participative interaction with the place its living culture and the people who live there
they feel like a citizen
99 saying so the tourist will have the opportunity to take part in workshops classes and activities related to the culture of the destination
more recently creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism drawing on active participation by travellers in the culture of the host communities they visit
several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development including the united kingdom austria france the bahamas jamaica spain italy new zealand and south korea
100101
the growing interest of tourists102 in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism highlighting the intangible heritage craft workshops cooking classes etc
and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure for example through the rent of halls and auditoriums
experiential travel or immersion travel is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry
it is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country city or particular place by connecting to its history people food and culture
103
the term experiential travel has been mentioned in publications since 1985104 but it was not discovered as a meaningful market trend until much later
one emerging area of special interest has been identified by lennon and foley 2000105106 as dark tourism
this type of tourism involves visits to dark sites such as battlegrounds scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide for example concentration camps

philip stone argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining ones own death through the real death of others
108 erik h cohen introduces the term populo sites to evidence the educational character of dark tourism
popular sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors
based on a study at yad vashem the shoah holocaust memorial museum in jerusalem a new term in populo is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell
learning about the shoah in jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in europe but equally authentic
it is argued that a dichotomy between authentic sites at the location of a tragedy and created sites elsewhere is insufficient
participants evaluations of seminars for european teachers at yad vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject
implications for other cases of dark tourism at in populo locations are discussed
109 in this vein peter tarlow defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths which continue to impact our lives
this issue can not be understood without the figure of trauma
110
victoria mitchell et al
suggest that dark tourism seems to be a heterogeneous discipline
there is a great dispersion of definitions knowledge production and meanings revolving around the term
in fact dark tourism practices vary in culture and time
qualitative speaking dark tourism experience is pretty different from leisure practices
to fill the gap the existent definitions should be catalogued in subcategories to form an allencompassing model that expands the current understanding of dark tourism
111 in consonance with this m apleni et al
argue dark tourism helps the industry not to be fragmented before the ongoing states of crises the activity often faces
they cite the case of terrorism which paves the way for the construction of a new dark site
dark tourism plays a leading role not only in enhancing destination resilience but also in helping communities to deal with traumatic experiences

social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation
it includes youth hostels and lowpriced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations trade unions or in communist times publicly owned enterprises

also known as tourism of doom or last chance tourism this emerging trend involves travelling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened such as the ice caps of mount kilimanjaro the melting glaciers of patagonia or the coral of the great barrier reef before it is too late
identified by travel trade magazine travel age west114 editorinchief kenneth shapiro in 2007 and later explored in the new york times115 this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise
some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming overpopulation or climate change
others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individuals carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing

religious tourism in particular pilgrimage can serve to strengthen faith and to demonstrate devotion both of which are central tenets of many major religions

tourism brings both positive and negative impacts on tourist destinations
the traditionallydescribed domains of tourism impacts are economic sociocultural and environmental dimensions
125126 the economic effects of tourism include improved tax revenue and personal income increased standards of living and more employment opportunities
127128 sociocultural impacts are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds attitudes and behaviors and relationships to material goods

134
tourism is sometimes associated with export or theft of contraband such as endangered species or certain cultural artifacts and illegal sex trade activities

in recent yearswhen
the local population in many areas has developed antitourism sentiment and begun to protest against tourists
one of the most prominent examples of such a mobilization was the socalled tourists go home movement which emerged in 2014 in spain due to slogans and mottos calling the tourists to go back to their homes
137 venice also faced such problems and the tourists go home slogans appeared on the walls of the city
138 moreover several other countries such as japan and the philippines are having problems with overtourism
139140
the year 2017 seems to be a landmark for antitourism sentiment as a new spanish social movement against an economic development model based on mass tourism gained following highprofile attacks targeting foreign tourists and local business interests
141 antitourism sentiment also seems to be linked to a clash of identity and peoples individualism

the world tourism organization unwto forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4
143 with the advent of ecommerce tourism products have become prominent traded items on the internet
144145 tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries although tourism providers hotels airlines etc
including smallscale operators can sell their services directly
146147 this has put pressure on intermediaries from both online and traditional shops
it has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context
148 not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies
this is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future
there has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism with only the russian space agency providing transport to date
a 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billiondollar market by 2030

tourism security is a subdiscipline of tourist studies that explores the factors that affect the ontological security of tourists
risks are evaluated by their impact and nature
151 tourism security includes methodologies theories and techniques oriented to protect the organic image of tourist destinations
152 three academic waves are significant in tourism security risk perception theory disaster management and postdisaster consumption
153
andrew spencer peter tarlow argue that tourism security is not an easy concept to define
it includes a set of subdisciplines and global risks different in nature which cause different effects in the tourism industry
the rise of tourism security and safety as a consolidated discipline coincides with the globalization and ultimate maturation of the industry worldwide
some threats include for example terrorist groups looking to destabilize governments affecting not only the local economies but killing foreign tourists to cause geopolitical tensions between deliverycountry and receivingtourist countries
today island destinations are more affected by terrorism and other global risks than other continent destinations 154 155
as a result of the late2000s recession international arrivals experienced a strong slowdown beginning in june 2008
growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 37 during the first eight months of 2008
this slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry with negative growth in september 2008 and a 33 growth in passenger traffic through september
the hotel industry also reported a slowdown with room occupancy declining
in 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 38

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic lockdowns travel bans and a substantial reduction in passenger travel by air and sea contributed to a sharp decline in tourism activity
159
however evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term
160 manyquantify people increasingly view vacations and travel as a necessity rather than a luxury and this is reflected in tourist numbers recoveringwhen
some 66 globally over 2009 with growth up to 8 in emerging economies
