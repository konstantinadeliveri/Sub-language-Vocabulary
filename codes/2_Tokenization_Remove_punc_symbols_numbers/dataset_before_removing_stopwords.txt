agriculture is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock
agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities
the history of agriculture began thousands of years ago
after gathering wild grains beginning at least  years ago nascent farmers began to plant them around  years ago
pigs sheep and cattle were domesticated over  years ago
plants were independently cultivated in at least  regions of the world
industrial agriculture based on largescale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output though about  billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture
the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuels and raw materials such as rubber
food classes include cereals grains vegetables fruits oils meat milk eggs and fungi
over onethird of the worlds workers are employed in agriculture second only to the service sector although in recent decades the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues especially in developing countries where smallholding is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization that brings an enormous crop yield increase
modern agronomy plant breeding agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields but causing ecological and environmental damage
selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage
environmental issues include contributions to global warming depletion of aquifers deforestation antibiotic resistance and growth hormones in industrial meat production
agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation such as biodiversity loss desertification soil degradation and global warming all of which can cause decreases in crop yield
genetically modified organisms are widely used although some are banned in certain countries
the word agriculture is a late middle english adaptation of latin agricultūra from ager field and cultūra cultivation or growing
while agriculture usually refers to human activities certain species of ant termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to  million years
agriculture is defined with varying scopes in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life including food fiber forest products horticultural crops and their related services
thus defined it includes arable farming horticulture animal husbandry and forestry but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded
the development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering
agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included a diverse range of taxa in at least  separate centres of origin
wild grains were collected and eaten from at least  years ago
from around  years ago the eight neolithic founder crops emmer and einkorn wheat hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax were cultivated in the levant
rice was domesticated in china between  and  bc with the earliest known cultivation from  bc followed by mung soy and azuki beans
sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between  and  years ago
cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan some  years ago
pig production emerged in eurasia including europe east asia and southwest asia where wild boar were first domesticated about  years ago
in the andes of south america the potato was domesticated between  and  years ago along with beans coca llamas alpacas and guinea pigs
sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around  years ago
sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by  years ago
cotton was domesticated in peru by  years ago and was independently domesticated in eurasia
in mesoamerica wild teosinte was bred into maize by  years ago
scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture
studies of the transition from huntergatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism examples are the natufian culture in the levant and the early chinese neolithic in china
then wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted and gradually came to be domesticated
in eurasia the sumerians started to live in villages from about  bc relying on the tigris and euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation
ploughs appear in pictographs around  bc seedploughs around  bc
farmers grew wheat barley vegetables such as lentils and onions and fruits including dates grapes and figs
ancient egyptian agriculture relied on the nile river and its seasonal flooding
farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the paleolithic after  bc
staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus
in india wheat barley and jujube were domesticated by  bc soon followed by sheep and goats
cattle sheep and goats were domesticated in mehrgarh culture by   bc
cotton was cultivated by the th th millennium bc
archeological evidence indicates an animaldrawn plough from  bc in the indus valley civilisation
in china from the th century bc there was a nationwide granary system and widespread silk farming
waterpowered grain mills were in use by the st century bc followed by irrigation
by the late nd century heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards
these spread westwards across eurasia
asian rice was domesticated   years ago depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used on the pearl river in southern china with a single genetic origin from the wild rice oryza rufipogon
in greece and rome the major cereals were wheat emmer and barley alongside vegetables including peas beans and olives
sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products
in the americas crops domesticated in mesoamerica apart from teosinte include squash beans and cacao
cocoa was being domesticated by the mayo chinchipe of the upper amazon around  bc
the turkey was probably domesticated in mexico or the american southwest
the aztecs developed irrigation systems formed terraced hillsides fertilized their soil and developed chinampas or artificial islands
the mayas used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland from  bc
coca was domesticated in the andes as were the peanut tomato tobacco and pineapple
cotton was domesticated in peru by  bc
animals including llamas alpacas and guinea pigs were domesticated there
in north america the indigenous people of the east domesticated crops such as sunflower tobacco squash and chenopodium
wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested
the domesticated strawberry is a hybrid of a chilean and a north american species developed by breeding in europe and north america
the indigenous people of the southwest and the pacific northwest practiced forest gardening and firestick farming
the natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a lowintensity fire ecology that sustained a lowdensity agriculture in loose rotation a sort of wild permaculture
a system of companion planting called the three sisters was developed in north america
the three crops were winter squash maize and climbing beans
indigenous australians long supposed to have been nomadic huntergatherers practised systematic burning possibly to enhance natural productivity in firestick farming
scholars have pointed out that huntergatherers need a productive environment to support gathering without cultivation
because the forests of new guinea have few food plants early humans may have used selective burning to increase the productivity of the wild karuka fruit trees to support the huntergatherer way of life
the gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and fish trapping systems from some  years ago
there is evidence of intensification across the whole continent over that period
in two regions of australia the central west coast and eastern central early farmers cultivated yams native millet and bush onions possibly in permanent settlements
in the middle ages both in europe and in the islamic world agriculture transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants including the introduction of sugar rice cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to europe by way of alandalus
after  the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize potatoes tomatoes sweet potatoes and manioc to europe and old world crops such as wheat barley rice and turnips and livestock including horses cattle sheep and goats to the americas
irrigation crop rotation and fertilizers advanced from the th century with the british agricultural revolution allowing global population to rise significantly
since  agriculture in developed nations and to a lesser extent in the developing world has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor and assisted by synthetic fertilizers pesticides and selective breeding
the haberbosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further increase in global population
modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological political and economic issues including water pollution biofuels genetically modified organisms tariffs and farm subsidies leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement
pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals
in nomadic pastoralism herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture fodder and water
this type of farming is practised in arid and semiarid regions of sahara central asia and some parts of india
in shifting cultivation a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees
the cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile and the area is abandoned
another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated
this type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly
this practice is used in northeast india southeast asia and the amazon basin
subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone with little left over for transport elsewhere
it is intensively practiced in monsoon asia and southeast asia
an estimated  billion subsistence farmers worked in  cultivating about  of the earths arable land
intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs water fertilizer pesticide and automation
it is practiced mainly in developed countries
from the twentieth century intensive agriculture increased productivity
it substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour but caused increased water pollution and often involved farm subsidies
in recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture resulting in the organic regenerative and sustainable agriculture movements
 one of the major forces behind this movement has been the european union which first certified organic food in  and began reform of its common agricultural policy cap in  to phase out commoditylinked farm subsidies also known as decoupling
the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management selective breeding and controlledenvironment agriculture
recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food
demand for nonfood biofuel crops development of former farm lands rising transportation costs climate change growing consumer demand in china and india and population growth are threatening food security in many parts of the world
the international fund for agricultural development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security given the favorable experience of vietnam
soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally approximately  of the worlds agricultural land is seriously degraded
by  the agricultural output of china was the largest in the world followed by the european union india and the united states
economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the united states is roughly  times more productive than it was in 
following the threesector theory the number of people employed in agriculture and other primary activities such as fishing can be more than  in the least developed countries and less than  in the most highly developed countries
since the industrial revolution many countries have made the transition to developed economies and the proportion of people working in agriculture has steadily fallen
during the th century in europe for example between  and  of the population was engaged in agriculture by the th century this had dropped to between  and 
in the same countries today the figure is less than 
at the start of the st century some one billion people or over  of the available work force were employed in agriculture
it constitutes approximately  of the global employment of children and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry
the service sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 
agriculture specifically farming remains a hazardous industry and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of workrelated injuries lung disease noiseinduced hearing loss skin diseases as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure
on industrialized farms injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers
pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can be hazardous to worker health and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects
as an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself entire families can be at risk for injuries illness and death
ages  may be an especially vulnerable population in agriculture common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning machinery and motor accidents including with allterrain vehicles
the international labour organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors
it estimates that the annual workrelated death toll among agricultural employees is at least  twice the average rate of other jobs
in addition incidences of death injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported
the organization has developed the safety and health in agriculture convention  which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play
in the united states agriculture has been identified by the national institute for occupational safety and health as a priority industry sector in the national occupational research agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues
in the european union the european agency for safety and health at work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture livestock farming horticulture and forestry
the agricultural safety and health council of america ashca also holds a yearly summit to discuss safety
overall production varies by country as listed
the twenty largest countries by agricultural output in nominal terms at peak level as of  according to the imf and cia world factbook
cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints geography and climate of the farm government policy economic social and political pressures and the philosophy and culture of the farmer
shifting cultivation or slash and burn is a system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years
then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to a new plot returning after many more years 
this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure and some manual pest control
annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period
this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs
further industrialization led to the use of monocultures when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage
because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers
multiple cropping in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year and intercropping when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures
in subtropical and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year or requiring irrigation
in all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry
in temperate environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system
important categories of food crops include cereals legumes forage fruits and vegetables
natural fibers include cotton wool hemp silk and flax
specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world
production is listed in millions of metric tons based on fao estimates
animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat milk eggs or wool and for work and transport
working animals including horses mules oxen water buffalo camels llamas alpacas donkeys and dogs have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields harvest crops wrangle other animals and transport farm products to buyers
livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source as grasslandbased mixed and landless
as of update  of earths ice and waterfree area was used for producing livestock with the sector employing approximately  billion people
between the s and the s there was a significant increase in livestock production both by numbers and by carcass weight especially among beef pigs and chickens the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 
nonmeat animals such as milk cows and eggproducing chickens also showed significant production increases
global cattle sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 
aquaculture or fish farming the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production growing at an average of  a year between  and 
during the second half of the th century producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity
this trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds
grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and pastures for feeding ruminant animals
outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source
this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing   million pastoralists
mixed production systems use grassland fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric one stomach mainly chickens and pigs livestock
manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops
landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the delinking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic cooperation and development member countries
synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution
industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork
scientists estimate that  of the growth in livestock production between  and  will be in confined animal feeding operations sometimes called factory farming
much of this growth is happening in developing countries in asia with much smaller amounts of growth in africa
some of the practices used in commercial livestock production including the usage of growth hormones are controversial
tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or harrow to prepare for planting for nutrient incorporation or for pest control
tillage varies in intensity from conventional to notill
it may improve productivity by warming the soil incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds but also renders soil more prone to erosion triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms
pest control includes the management of weeds insects mites and diseases
chemical pesticides biological biocontrol mechanical tillage and cultural practices are used
cultural practices include crop rotation culling cover crops intercropping composting avoidance and resistance
integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss and recommends pesticides as a last resort
nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production and the method of use of manure produced by livestock
nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers manure green manure compost and minerals
crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period
manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing such as in managed intensive rotational grazing or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures
water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world
some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall
in other areas such as the great plains in the us and canada farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year
agriculture represents  of freshwater use worldwide
according to a report by the international food policy research institute agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by  the international food policy research institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as  and food prices could be reduced by almost half
payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment
measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city to improve the supply of fresh water
crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization
altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic makeup of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds droughttolerance or resistance to pests
significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel
his work on dominant and recessive alleles although initially largely ignored for almost  years gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques
crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits selfpollination and crosspollination and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism
domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants
careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants
plant selection and breeding in the s and s improved pasture grasses and clover in new zealand
extensive xray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts ie
primitive genetic engineering during the s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn maize and barley
the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating highyielding varieties
for example average yields of corn maize in the us have increased from around  tons per hectare tha  bushels per acre in  to about  tha  bushels per acre in 
similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than  tha in  to more than  tha in 
south american average wheat yields are around  tha african under  tha and egypt and arabia up to  to  tha with irrigation
in contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over  tha
variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control growth control to avoid lodging
genetically modified organisms gmo are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology
genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops
increased durability nutritional content insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering
for some gmo crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns
numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production import or use of gmo foods and crops
currently a global treaty the biosafety protocol regulates the trade of gmos
there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled the us does not
herbicideresistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides including glyphosate
these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop
herbicidetolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide
with the increasing use of herbicidetolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosatebased herbicide sprays
in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides
some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications
other gmo crops used by growers include insectresistant crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt which produces a toxin specific to insects
these crops resist damage by insects
some believe that similar or better pestresistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or crosspollination with wild species
in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least  diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes
agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation such as biodiversity loss desertification soil degradation and global warming which cause decrease in crop yield
agriculture is one of the most important drivers of environmental pressures particularly habitat change climate change water use and toxic emissions
agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment including insecticides especially those used on cotton
page needed the  unep green economy report stated that agricultural operations produced some  per cent of anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions
this includes gases from the use of inorganic fertilizers agrochemical pesticides and herbicides as well as fossil fuelenergy inputs
agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature especially herbicides and insecticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage and loss of natural environment
a assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for  of  million or  per hectare
a  analysis of these costs in the us concluded that cropland imposes approximately  to  billion  to  per hectare while livestock production imposes  million
both studies which focused solely on the fiscal impacts concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs
neither included subsidies in their analysis but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society
agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs
yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens predators and competitors such as weeds
costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units such as making fields larger this means removing hedges ditches and other areas of habitat
pesticides kill insects plants and fungi
these and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land
effective yields fall with onfarm losses which may be caused by poor production practices during harvesting handling and storage
a senior un official henning steinfeld said that livestock are one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems
livestock production occupies  of all land used for agriculture or  of the land surface of the planet
it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases responsible for  of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co equivalents
by comparison all transportation emits  of the co
it produces  of humanrelated nitrous oxide which has  times the global warming potential of co and  of all humaninduced methane which is  times as warming as co
it also generates  of the ammonia emission
livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation in the amazon basin  of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops
through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity
furthermore the unep states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by  per cent by  under current practices and consumption patterns
land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the earths ecosystems and is the driving force causing biodiversity loss
estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from  to 
land degradation the longterm decline in ecosystem function and productivity is estimated to be occurring on  of land worldwide with cropland overrepresented
land management is the driving factor behind degradation  billion people rely upon the degrading land
degradation can be through deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion acidification or salinization
eutrophication excessive nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia leads to fish kills loss of biodiversity and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses
excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient mainly nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and leaching from agricultural land
these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater with harmful effects on human populations
fertilisers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light favouring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients
agriculture accounts for  percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources
agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate
it is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern china the upper ganges and the western us are being depleted and new research extends these problems to aquifers in iran mexico and saudi arabia
increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the worlds growing population with reduced water resources
agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems including the destruction of natural wetlands the spread of waterborne diseases and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging when irrigation is performed incorrectly
pesticide use has increased since  to  million short tons annually worldwide yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant
the world health organization estimated in  that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually causing  deaths
pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide
an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website growing more per acre leaves more land for nature
however critics argue that a tradeoff between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation
the push pull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping using plant aromas to repel pests from crops push and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed pull
climate change and agriculture are interrelated on a global scale
global warming affects agriculture through changes in average temperatures rainfall and weather extremes like storms and heat waves changes in pests and diseases changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and groundlevel ozone concentrations changes in the nutritional quality of some foods and changes in sea level
global warming is already affecting agriculture with effects unevenly distributed across the world
future climate change will probably negatively affect crop production in low latitude countries while effects in northern latitudes may be positive or negative
global warming will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups such as the poor
animal husbandry is also responsible for greenhouse gas production of co and a percentage of the worlds methane and future land infertility and the displacement of wildlife
agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and by the conversion of nonagricultural land such as forest for agricultural use
agriculture forestry and landuse change contributed around  to  to global annual emissions in 
a range of policies can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector
current farming methods have resulted in overstretched water resources high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility
there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices therefore how critical water land and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered
a solution would be to give value to ecosystems recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests
inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights
technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable
technology permits innovations like conservation tillage a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion reduces water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration
other potential practices include conservation agriculture agroforestry improved grazing avoided grassland conversion and biochar
current monocrop farming practices in the united states preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices such as  crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy
the international food policy research institute states that agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by  it found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as  and food prices could be reduced by almost half
the food demand of earths projected population with current climate change predictions could be satisfied by improvement of agricultural methods expansion of agricultural areas and a sustainabilityoriented consumer mindset
since the s agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due largely to the increased use of energyintensive mechanization fertilizers and pesticides
the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources
between the s and the s the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe with world grain production increasing significantly between  and  for wheat and  to  for rice depending on geographic area as world population doubled
heavy reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output
industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm
direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery
indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers pesticides and farm machinery
in particular the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural energy usage
together direct and indirect consumption by us farms accounts for about  of the nations energy use
direct and indirect energy consumption by us farms peaked in  and has since gradually declined
food systems encompass not just agriculture but offfarm processing packaging transporting marketing consumption and disposal of food and foodrelated items
agriculture accounts for less than onefifth of food system energy use in the us
agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the production distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services
combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late s and grew significantly through the th century
although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the postamerican civil war southern united states to the european feudal system of manorialism
in the united states and elsewhere food costs attributed to food processing distribution and agricultural marketing sometimes referred to as the value chain have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined
this is related to the greater efficiency of farming combined with the increased level of value addition eg
more highly processed products provided by the supply chain
market concentration has increased in the sector as well and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers farmers and consumers and may have negative implications for rural communities
national government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products in the form of taxation subsidies tariffs and other measures
since at least the s a combination of trade restrictions exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world
in the s nonsubsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products
between the mids and the early s several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs subsidies and other trade restrictions
however as of update there was still a significant amount of policydriven distortion in global agricultural product prices
the three agricultural products with the most trade distortion were sugar milk and rice mainly due to taxation
among the oilseeds sesame had the most taxation but overall feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products
since the s policydriven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy
despite this progress certain crops such as cotton still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices causing hardship in developing countries with nonsubsidized farmers
unprocessed commodities such as corn soybeans and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality affecting the price the producer receives
commodities are generally reported by production quantities such as volume number or weight
agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture
it covers topics such as agronomy plant breeding and genetics plant pathology crop modelling soil science entomology production techniques and improvement study of pests and their management and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation waste management and bioremediation
the scientific study of agriculture began in the th century when johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum hydrated calcium sulphate as a fertilizer
research became more systematic when in  john lawes and henry gilbert began a set of longterm agronomy field experiments at rothamsted research station in england some of them such as the park grass experiment are still running
in america the hatch act of  provided funding for what it was the first to call agricultural science driven by farmers interest in fertilizers
in agricultural entomology the usda began to research biological control in  it instituted its first large program in  searching europe and japan for natural enemies of the gypsy moth and browntail moth establishing parasitoids such as solitary wasps and predators of both pests in the usa
agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products
governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets
some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment including policies related to climate change food safety and natural disasters economic stability including policies related to taxes natural resources and environmental sustainability especially water policy research and development and market access for domestic commodities including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries
agricultural policy can also touch on food quality ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality food security ensuring that the food supply meets the populations needs and conservation
policy programs can range from financial programs such as subsidies to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs
there are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy including consumers agribusiness trade lobbies and other groups
agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions
political action groups including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions also provide influence as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements
samuel jutzi director of faos animal production and health division states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment
for example proposals in  for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health and environmental regulations such as the number of animals an area of land can support without longterm damage were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure
the environmental impact of agriculture is the effect that different farming practices have on the ecosystems around them and how those effects can be traced back to those practices
the environmental impact of agriculture varies widely based on practices employed by farmers and by the scale of practice
farming communities that try to reduce environmental impacts through modifying their practices will adopt sustainable agriculture practices
though some pastoralism is environmentally positive modern animal agriculture practices tend to be more environmentally destructive than agricultural practices focused on fruits vegetables and other biomass
when evaluating environmental impact experts use two types of indicators meansbased which is based on the farmers production methods and effectbased which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment
an example of a meansbased indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is effected by the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil
an indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effectbased
the meansbased evaluation looks at farmers practices of agriculture and the effectbased evaluation considers the actual effects of the agricultural system
for example the meansbased analysis might look at pesticides and fertilization methods that farmers are using and effectbased analysis would consider how much co is being emitted or what the nitrogen content of the soil is
the environmental impact of agriculture involves impacts on a variety of different factors the soil to water the air animal and soil variety people plants and the food itself
agriculture contributes to a number larger of environmental issues that cause environmental degradation including climate change deforestation biodiversity loss dead zones genetic engineering irrigation problems pollutants soil degradation and waste
because of agricultures importance to global social and environmental systems the international community has committed to increasing sustainability of food production as part of sustainable development goal  end hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
the united nations environment programmes  making peace with nature report highlighted agriculture as both a driver and an industry under threat from environmental degradation
the environmental impact of meat production varies because of the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world
all agricultural practices have been found to have a variety of effects on the environment
some of the environmental effects that have been associated with meat production are pollution through fossil fuel usage animal methane effluent waste and water and land consumption
meat is obtained through a variety of methods including organic farming free range farming intensive livestock production subsistence agriculture hunting and fishing
meat is considered one of the prime factors contributing to the current sixth mass extinction
the  ipbes global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services found that industrial agriculture and overfishing are the primary drivers of the extinction crisis with the meat and dairy industries having a substantial impact
the  report livestocks long shadow released by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations states that the livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as a whole
globally it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases ghg and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity and in developed and emerging countries it is perhaps the leading source of water pollution
in this and much other fao usage but not always elsewhere poultry are included as livestock
a study published in the journal carbon balance and management found animal agricultures global methane emissions are  higher than previous estimates based on data from the intergovernmental panel on climate change
some fraction of these effects is assignable to nonmeat components of the livestock sector such as the wool egg and dairy industries and to the livestock used for tillage
livestock have been estimated to provide power for tillage of as much as half of the worlds cropland
a july  study in science asserts that meat consumption will increase as the result of human population growth and rising individual incomes which will increase carbon emissions and further reduce biodiversity
the environmental impacts of irrigation relate to the changes in quantity and quality of soil and water as a result of irrigation and the effects on natural and social conditions in river basins and downstream of an irrigation scheme
the impacts stem from the altered hydrological conditions caused by the installation and operation of the irrigation scheme
the impact of pesticides consists of the effects of pesticides on nontarget species
pesticides are chemical preparations used to kill fungal or animal pests
over  of sprayed insecticides and  of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species because they are sprayed or spread across entire agricultural fields
runoff can carry pesticides into aquatic environments while wind can carry them to other fields grazing areas human settlements and undeveloped areas potentially affecting other species
other problems emerge from poor production transport and storage practices
over time repeated application increases pest resistance while its effects on other species can facilitate the pests resurgence
climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes both of which take place on a worldwide scale
global warming is projected to have significant impacts on conditions affecting agriculture including temperature precipitation and glacial runoff
these conditions determine the carrying capacity of the biosphere to produce enough food for the human population and domesticated animals
rising carbon dioxide levels would also have effects both detrimental and beneficial on crop yields
assessment of the effects of global climate changes on agriculture might help to properly anticipate and adapt farming to maximize agricultural production
although the net impact of climate change on agricultural production is uncertain it is likely that it will shift the suitable growing zones for individual crops
adjustment to this geographical shift will involve considerable economic costs and social impacts
at the same time agriculture has been shown to produce significant effects on climate change primarily through the production and release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide
in addition agriculture that practices tillage fertilization and pesticide application also releases ammonia nitrate phosphorus and many other pesticides that affect air water and soil quality as well as biodiversity
agriculture also alters the earths land cover which can change its ability to absorb or reflect heat and light thus contributing to radiative forcing
land use change such as deforestation and desertification together with use of fossil fuels are the major anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide agriculture itself is the major contributor to increasing methane and nitrous oxide concentrations in earths atmosphere
most of the methane emissions result from the use of livestock in particular ruminants such as cattle and pigs
other livestock as poultry fish has a far lower impact
some solutions are being developed to counter the emissions of ruminants
strategies include using biogas from manure genetic selection immunization rumen defaunation outcompetition of methanogenic archaea with acetogens introduction of methanotrophic bacteria into the rumen diet modification and grazing management among others
certain diet changes such as with asparagopsis taxiformis allow for a reduction of up to  in ruminant greenhouse gas emissions
due to these negative impacts but also for reasons of farming efficiency see food vs feed one projection mentions a large decline of livestock at least some animals ie
cattle in certain countries by 
deforestation is clearing the earths forests on a large scale worldwide and resulting in many land damages
one of the causes of deforestation is to clear land for pasture or crops
according to british environmentalist norman myers  of deforestation is due to cattle ranching  due to overheavy logging  due to the growing sector of palm oil plantations and  due to slashandburn farming
deforestation causes the loss of habitat for millions of species and is also a driver of climate change
trees act as a carbon sink that is they absorb carbon dioxide an unwanted greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere
removing trees releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and leaves behind fewer trees to absorb the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the air
in this way deforestation exacerbates climate change
when trees are removed from forests the soils tend to dry out because there is no longer shade and there are not enough trees to assist in the water cycle by returning water vapor back to the environment
with no trees landscapes that were once forests can potentially become barren deserts
the removal of trees also causes extreme fluctuations in temperature
in the united nations food and agriculture organization fao found that the role of population dynamics in a local setting may vary from decisive to negligible and that deforestation can result from a combination of population pressure and stagnating economic social and technological conditions
agricultural pollution refers to biotic and abiotic byproducts of farming practices that result in contamination or degradation of the environment and surrounding ecosystems andor cause injury to humans and their economic interests
the pollution may come from a variety of sources ranging from point source water pollution from a single discharge point to more diffuse landscapelevel causes also known as nonpoint source pollution and air pollution
once in the environment these pollutants can have both direct effects in surrounding ecosystems ie
killing local wildlife or contaminating drinking water and downstream effects such as dead zones caused by agricultural runoff is concentrated in large water bodies
management practices or ignorance of them play a crucial role in the amount and impact of these pollutants
management techniques range from animal management and housing to the spread of pesticides and fertilizers in global agricultural practicesbad managament practices include poorly managed animal feeding operations overgrazing plowing fertilizer and improper excessive or badly timed use of pesticides
pollutants from agriculture greatly affect water quality and can be found in lakes rivers wetlands estuaries and groundwater
pollutants from farming include sediments nutrients pathogens pesticides metals and salts
animal agriculture has an outsized impact on pollutants that enter the environment
bacteria and pathogens in manure can make their way into streams and groundwater if grazing storing manure in lagoons and applying manure to fields is not properly managed
air pollution caused by agriculture through land use changes and animal agriculture practices have an outsized impact on climate change and addressing these concerns were a central part of the ipcc special report on climate change and land
soil degradation is the decline in soil quality that can be a result of many factors especially from agriculture
soils hold the majority of the worlds biodiversity and healthy soils are essential for food production and adequate water supply
common attributes of soil degradation can be salting waterlogging compaction pesticide contamination a decline in soil structure quality loss of fertility changes in soil acidity alkalinity salinity and erosion
soil erosion is the wearing away of topsoil by water wind or farming activities
topsoil is very fertile which makes it valuable to farmers growing crops
soil degradation also has a huge impact on biological degradation which affects the microbial community of the soil and can alter nutrient cycling pest and disease control and chemical transformation properties of the soil
plasticulture is the use of plastic mulch in agriculture
farmers use plastic sheets as mulch to cover  of the soil and allow them to use drip irrigation systems to have better control over soil nutrients and moisture
rain is not required in this system and farms that use plasticulture are built to encourage the fastest runoff of rain
the use of pesticides with plasticulture allows pesticides to be transported easier in the surface runoff towards wetlands or tidal creeks
the runoff from pesticides and chemicals in the plastic can cause serious deformations and death in shellfish as the runoff carries the chemicals towards the oceans
in addition to the increased runoff that results from plasticulture there is also the problem of the increased amount of waste from the plastic mulch itself
the use of plastic mulch for vegetables strawberries and other row and orchard crops exceeds  million pounds annually in the united states
most plastic ends up in the landfill although there are other disposal options such as disking mulches into the soil onsite burying onsite storage reuse recycling and incineration
the incineration and recycling options are complicated by the variety of the types of plastics that are used and by the geographic dispersal of the plastics
plastics also contain stabilizers and dyes as well as heavy metals which limits the number of products that can be recycled
research is continually being conducted on creating biodegradable or photodegradable mulches
while there has been a minor success with this there is also the problem of how long the plastic takes to degrade as many biodegradable products take a long time to break down
the environmental impact of agriculture can vary depending on the region as well as the type of agriculture production method that is being used
listed below are some specific environmental issues in various different regions around the world
sustainable agriculture is the idea that agriculture should occur in a way such that we can continue to produce what is necessary without infringing on the ability for future generations to do the same
the exponential population increase in recent decades has increased the practice of agricultural land conversion to meet the demand for food which in turn has increased the effects on the environment
the global population is still increasing and will eventually stabilize as some critics doubt that food production due to lower yields from global warming can support the global population
agriculture can have negative effects on biodiversity as well
organic farming is a multifaceted sustainable agriculture set of practices that can have a lower impact on the environment at a small scale
however in most cases organic farming results in lower yields in terms of production per unit area
therefore widespread adoption of organic agriculture will require additional land to be cleared and water resources extracted to meet the same level of production
a european metaanalysis found that organic farms tended to have higher soil organic matter content and lower nutrient losses nitrogen leaching nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia emissions per unit of field area but higher ammonia emissions nitrogen leaching and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit
it is believed by many that conventional farming systems cause less rich biodiversity than organic systems
organic farming has shown to have on average  higher species richness than conventional farming
organic systems on average also have  more organisms
this data has some issues because there were several results that showed a negative effect on these things when in an organic farming system
the opposition to organic agriculture believes that these negatives are an issue with the organic farming system
what began as a small scale environmentally conscious practice has now become just as industrialized as conventional agriculture
this industrialization can lead to the issues shown above such as climate change and deforestation
regenerative agriculture is a conservation and rehabilitation approach to food and farming systems
it focuses on topsoil regeneration increasing biodiversity improving the water cycle enhancing ecosystem services supporting biosequestration increasing resilience to climate change and strengthening the health and vitality of farm soil
practices include recycling as much farm waste as possible and adding composted material from sources outside the farm
regenerative agriculture on small farms and gardens is often based on philosophies like permaculture agroecology agroforestry restoration ecology keyline design and holistic management
large farms tend to be less philosophy driven and often use notill andor reduced till practices
as soil health improves input requirements may decrease and crop yields may increase as soils are more resilient against extreme weather and harbour fewer pests and pathogens
conservation tillage is an alternative tillage method for farming which is more sustainable for the soil and surrounding ecosystem
this is done by allowing the residue of the previous harvests crops to remain in the soil before tilling for the next crop
conservation tillage has shown to improve many things such as soil moisture retention and reduce erosion
some disadvantages are the fact that more expensive equipment is needed for this process more pesticides will need to be used and the positive effects take a long time to be visible
the barriers of instantiating a conservation tillage policy are that farmers are reluctant to change their methods and would protest a more expensive and timeconsuming method of tillage than the conventional one they are used to
biological control or biocontrol is a method of controlling pests such as insects mites weeds and plant diseases using other organisms
it relies on predation parasitism herbivory or other natural mechanisms but typically also involves an active human management role
it can be an important component of integrated pest management ipm programs
there are three basic strategies for biological pest control classical importation where a natural enemy of a pest is introduced in the hope of achieving control inductive augmentation in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control and inoculative conservation in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment
natural enemies of insect pests also known as biological control agents include predators parasitoids pathogens and competitors
biological control agents of plant diseases are most often referred to as antagonists
biological control agents of weeds include seed predators herbivores and plant pathogens
a farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops it is the basic facility in food production
the name is used for specialised units such as arable farms vegetable farms fruit farms dairy pig and poultry farms and land used for the production of natural fibres biofuel and other commodities
it includes ranches feedlots orchards plantations and estates smallholdings and hobby farms and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land
in modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms both of which can operate on land or sea
farming originated independently in different parts of the world as hunter gatherer societies transitioned to food production rather than food capture
it may have started about  years ago with the domestication of livestock in the fertile crescent in western asia soon to be followed by the cultivation of crops
modern units tend to specialise in the crops or livestock best suited to the region with their finished products being sold for the retail market or for further processing with farm products being traded around the world
modern farms in developed countries are highly mechanized
in the united states livestock may be raised on rangeland and finished in feedlots and the mechanization of crop production has brought about a great decrease in the number of agricultural workers needed
in europe traditional family farms are giving way to larger production units
in australia some farms are very large because the land is unable to support a high stocking density of livestock because of climatic conditions
in less developed countries small farms are the norm and the majority of rural residents are subsistence farmers feeding their families and selling any surplus products in the local market
the word in the sense of an agricultural landholding derives from the verb to farm a revenue source whether taxes customs rents of a group of manors or simply to hold an individual manor by the feudal land tenure of fee farm
the word is from the medieval latin noun firma also the source of the french word ferme meaning a fixed agreement contract from the classical latin adjective firmus meaning strong stout firm
as in the medieval age virtually all manors were engaged in the business of agriculture which was their principal revenue source so to hold a manor by the tenure of fee farm became synonymous with the practice of agriculture itself
farming has been innovated at multiple different points and places in human history
the transition from huntergatherer to settled agricultural societies is called the neolithic revolution and first began around  years ago near the beginning of the geological epoch of the holocene around  years ago
it was the worlds first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture
subsequent stepchanges in human farming practices were provoked by the british agricultural revolution in the th century and the green revolution of the second half of the th century
farming spread from the middle east to europe and by  bc people that lived in the central part of europe were using oxen to pull plows and wagons
a farm may be owned and operated by a single individual family community corporation or a company may produce one or many types of produce and can be a holding of any size from a fraction of a hectare to several thousand hectares
a farm may operate under a monoculture system or with a variety of cereal or arable crops which may be separate from or combined with raising livestock
specialist farms are often denoted as such thus a dairy farm fish farm poultry farm or mink farm
some farms may not use the word at all hence vineyard grapes orchard nuts and other fruit market garden or truck farm vegetables and flowers
some farms may be denoted by their topographical location such as a hill farm while large estates growing cash crops such as cotton or coffee may be called plantations
many other terms are used to describe farms to denote their methods of production as in collective corporate intensive organic or vertical
other farms may primarily exist for research or education such as an ant farm and since farming is synonymous with mass production the word farm may be used to describe wind power generation or puppy farm
dairy farming is a class of agriculture where female cattle goats or other mammals are raised for their milk which may be either processed onsite or transported to a dairy for processing and eventual retail sale there are many breeds of cattle that can be milked some of the best producing ones include holstein norwegian red kostroma brown swiss and more
in most western countries a centralized dairy facility processes milk and dairy products such as cream butter and cheese
in the united states these dairies are usually local companies while in the southern hemisphere facilities may be run by very large nationwide or transnational corporations such as fonterra
dairy farms generally sell male calves for veal meat as dairy breeds are not normally satisfactory for commercial beef production
many dairy farms also grow their own feed typically including corn alfalfa and hay
this is fed directly to the cows or stored as silage for use during the winter season
additional dietary supplements are added to the feed to improve milk production
poultry farms are devoted to raising chickens egg layers or broilers turkeys ducks and other fowl generally for meat or eggs
a pig farm is one that specializes in raising pigs or hogs for bacon ham and other pork products
they may be free range intensive or both
farm control and ownership has traditionally been a key indicator of status and power especially in medieval european agrarian societies
the distribution of farm ownership has historically been closely linked to form of government
medieval feudalism was essentially a system that centralized control of farmland control of farm labor and political power while the early american democracy in which land ownership was a prerequisite for voting rights was built on relatively easy paths to individual farm ownership
however the gradual modernization and mechanization of farming which greatly increases both the efficiency and capital requirements of farming has led to increasingly large farms
this has usually been accompanied by the decoupling of political power from farm ownership
citation needed
in some societies especially socialist and communist collective farming is the norm with either government ownership of the land or common ownership by a local group
especially in societies without widespread industrialized farming tenant farming and sharecropping are common farmers either pay landowners for the right to use farmland or give up a portion of the crops
the land and buildings of a farm are called the farmstead
citation needed
enterprises where livestock are raised on rangeland are called ranches
where livestock are raised in confinement on feed produced elsewhere the term feedlot is usually used

the share of us farms operated by women has risen steadily over recent decades from  percent in  to  percent by 
in the united states there are over three million migrant and seasonal farmworkers  are foreignborn  are male they have an average age of  and average education of  years
farmworkers make an average hourly rate of   per hour compared to an average of over  per hour for nonfarm labor

according to the world bank most empirical evidence indicates that land productivity on large farms in pakistan is lower than that of small farms holding other factors constant
small farmers have higher net returns per hectare than large farms according to farm
household income data
nepal is an agricultural country and about  of the total population are engaged in farming
rice is mainly produced in nepal along with fruits like apples
dairy farming and poultry farming are also growing in nepal
farming is a significant economic sector in australia
a farm is an area of land used for primary production which will include buildings
according to the un green agriculture directs a greater share of total farming input expenditures towards the purchase of locally sourced inputeg
labour and organic fertilisers and a local multiplier effect is expected to kick in
overall green farming practices tend to require more labour inputs than conventional farming eg
from comparable levels to as much as  per cent more fao  and european commission  creating jobs in rural areas and a higher return on labour inputs
where most of the income is from some other employment and the farm is really an expanded residence the term hobby farm is common
this will allow sufficient size for recreational use but be very unlikely to produce sufficient income to be selfsustaining
hobby farms are commonly around  hectares  acres but may be much larger depending upon land prices which vary regionally
often very small farms used for intensive primary production are referred to by the specialization they are being used for such as a dairy rather than a dairy farm a piggery a market garden etc
this also applies to feedlots which are specifically developed to a single purpose and are often not able to be used for more general purpose mixed farming practices
in remote areas farms can become quite large
as with estates in england there is no defined size or method of operation at which a large farm becomes a station
in the uk farm as an agricultural unit always denotes the area of pasture and other fields together with its farmhouse farmyard and outbuildings
large farms or groups of farms under the same ownership may be called an estate
conversely a small farm surrounding the owners dwelling is called a smallholding and is generally focused on selfsufficiency with only the surplus being sold
a farm in africa includes various structures
depending on climaterelated areas primarily farming is the raising and breeding of grazing livestock such as cattle sheep ostriches horses or goats
predominantly domestic animals are raised for their meat milk skin leather or fiber wool
you might even come across silk farms
furthermore there are plenty of hunting farms guest farms and game farms
arable or irrigated land is often used for raising crops such as feed grains and hay for animal feeding
on some farms astro farm stargazing became very popular because of the excellent optical quality in the desert
the high energy stereoscopic system hess
which investigates cosmic gamma rays is situated on farm göllschau in namibia
farm equipment has evolved over the centuries from simple hand tools such as the hoe through ox or horsedrawn equipment such as the plough and harrow to the modern highly technical machinery such as the tractor baler and combine harvester replacing what was a highly labourintensive occupation before the industrial revolution
today much of the farm equipment used on both small and large farms is automated eg
using satellite guided farming
as new types of hightech farm equipment have become inaccessible to farmers that historically fixed their own equipment wired reports there is a growing backlash due mostly to companies using intellectual property law to prevent farmers from having the legal right to fix their equipment or gain access to the information to allow them to do it
this has encouraged groups such as open source ecology and farm hack to begin to make open source hardware for agricultural machinery
in addition on a smaller scale farmbot  and the reprap open source d printer community has begun to make opensource farm tools available of increasing levels of sophistication
meaning of farmer types of farmer five richest farmers
a farmer also called an agriculturer is a person engaged in agriculture raising living organisms for food or raw materials
the term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops orchards vineyards poultry or other livestock
a farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others but in advanced economies a farmer is usually a farm owner while employees of the farm are known as farm workers or farmhands
however in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of a plant crop etc
by labor and attention land or crops or raises animals as livestock or fish
farming dates back as far as the neolithic being one of the defining characteristics of that era
by the bronze age the sumerians had an agriculture specialized labor force by   bce and heavily depended on irrigation to grow crops
they relied on threeperson teams when harvesting in the spring
the ancient egypt farmers farmed and relied and irrigated their water from the nile
animal husbandry the practice of rearing animals specifically for farming purposes has existed for thousands of years
dogs were domesticated in east asia about  years ago
goats and sheep were domesticated around  bce in asia
swine or pigs were domesticated by  bce in the middle east and china
the earliest evidence of horse domestication dates to around  bce
in the us of the s one farmer could only produce enough food to feed three other consumers
a modernday farmer produces enough food to feed well over a hundred people
however some authors consider this estimate to be flawed as it does not take into account that farming requires energy and many other resources which have to be provided by additional workers so that the ratio of people fed to farmers is actually smaller than  to 
more distinct terms are commonly used to denote farmers who raise specific domesticated animals
for example those who raise grazing livestock such as cattle sheep goats and horses are known as ranchers us graziers australia uk or simply stockmen
sheep goat and cattle farmers might also be referred to respectively as shepherds goatherds and cowherds
the term dairy farmer is applied to those engaged primarily in milk production whether from cattle goats sheep or other milk producing animals
a poultry farmer is one who concentrates on raising chickens turkeys ducks or geese for either meat egg or feather production or commonly all three
a person who raises a variety of vegetables for market may be called a truck farmer or market gardener
dirt farmer is an american colloquial term for a practical farmer or one who farms his own land
in developed nations a farmer as a profession is usually defined as someone with an ownership interest in crops or livestock and who provides land or management in their production
those who provide only labor are most often called farmhands
alternatively growers who manage farmland for an absentee landowner sharing the harvest or its profits are known as sharecroppers or sharefarmers
in the context of agribusiness a farmer is defined broadly and thus many individuals not necessarily engaged in fulltime farming can nonetheless legally qualify under agricultural policy for various subsidies incentives and tax deductions
in the context of developing nations or other preindustrial cultures most farmers practice a meager subsistence agriculture a simple organicfarming system employing crop rotation seed saving slash and burn or other techniques to maximize efficiency while meeting the needs of the household or community
one subsisting in this way may become labelled as a peasant often associated disparagingly with a peasant mentality
in developed nations however a person using such techniques on small patches of land might be called a gardener and be considered a hobbyist
alternatively one might be driven into such practices by poverty or ironically against the background of largescale agribusiness might become an organic farmer growing for discerningfaddish consumers in the local food market
farmers are often members of local regional or national farmers unions or agricultural producers organizations and can exert significant political influence
the grange movement in the united states was effective in advancing farmers agendas especially against railroad and agribusiness interests early in the th century
the fnsea is very politically active in france especially pertaining to genetically modified food
agricultural producers both small and large are represented globally by the international federation of agricultural producers ifap representing over  million farmers through  national farmers unions in  countries
farmed products might be sold either to a market in a farmers market or directly from a farm
in a subsistence economy farm products might to some extent be either consumed by the farmers family or pooled by the community
there are several occupational hazards for those in agriculture farming is a particularly dangerous industry
farmers can encounter and be stung or bitten by dangerous insects and other arthropods including scorpions fire ants bees wasps and hornets
farmers also work around heavy machinery which can kill or injure them
farmers can also establish muscle and joints pains from repeated work
the word farmer originally meant a person collecting taxes from tenants working a field owned by a landlord
the word changed to refer to the person farming the field
previous names for a farmer were churl and husbandman

any plant that is welladapted to environments in which the land is cultivated for growing some other plant
see also crop weed
wildcrafting
the human practice of foraging for uncultivated plants or fungi from their natural or wild habitats primarily for food or medicine
wildculture
windbreak
also called a shelterbelt
one or more rows of closely spaced trees or shrubs planted in such a way as to provide shelter to an adjacent agricultural field from the wind thereby protecting the area from excessive cold and soil erosion
windbreaks commonly take the form of hedgerows planted around the edges of fields on farms but may also be made from artificial materials such as large canvas panels
aside from decreasing wind speeds they may also be designed to separate farms from roads or motorways or to collect snowdrifts that will provide water to otherwise dry farmland when the snow melts in the spring
windrow
a row of cut or mown hay or small grain crop that is allowed to dry in a field before being baled combined or rolled
windrows may be built deliberately after cutting or they may form automatically as a result of the method by which the crop is mown
winnowing
the process or technique performed either manually or mechanically by which grain is separated from chaff
traditional manual winnowing involves throwing the unseparated mixture into the air so that the wind blows away the lighter chaff while the heavier grains fall back to the ground for recovery
in modern agriculture winnowing is often entirely mechanized
xeriscaping
the practice of gardening or landscaping so as to reduce or eliminate the need for supplemental water from irrigation
xeriscaping requires the selection of plants whose natural requirements are appropriate to the local climate with a particular emphasis on water conservation and focuses on designing and maintaining the land in such a way as to avoid losing water to evaporation and runoff

the history of agriculture records the domestication of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively
agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included a diverse range of taxa
at least eleven separate regions of the old and new world were involved as independent centers of origin
wild grains were collected and eaten from at least  years ago
 however domestication did not occur until much later
starting from around  bc the eight neolithic founder crops emmer wheat einkorn wheat hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chickpeas and flax were cultivated in the levant
 rye may have been cultivated earlier but this remains controversial
 rice was domesticated in china by  bc with earliest known cultivation from  bc followed by mung soy and azuki beans
pigs were domesticated in mesopotamia around  bc followed by sheep between  bc and  bc
cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and india around  bc
sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around  bc
sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by  bc
in the andes of south america the potato was domesticated between  bc and  bc along with beans coca llamas alpacas and guinea pigs
bananas were cultivated and hybridized in the same period in papua new guinea
in mesoamerica wild teosinte was domesticated to maize by  bc
cotton was domesticated in peru by  bc
camels were domesticated late perhaps around  bc
in australia agriculture was invented at a currently unspecified period with the oldest eel traps of budj bim dating to  bc and the deployment of several crops ranging from yams to bananas
the bronze age from c  bc witnessed the intensification of agriculture in civilizations such as mesopotamian sumer ancient egypt the indus valley civilisation of the indian subcontinent ancient china and ancient greece
during the iron age and era of classical antiquity the expansion of ancient rome both the republic and then the empire throughout the ancient mediterranean and western europe built upon existing systems of agriculture while also establishing the manorial system that became a bedrock of medieval agriculture
in the middle ages both in the islamic world and in europe agriculture was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants including the introduction of sugar rice cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to europe by way of alandalus
after the voyages of christopher columbus in  the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize potatoes sweet potatoes and manioc to europe and old world crops such as wheat barley rice and turnips and livestock including horses cattle sheep and goats to the americas
irrigation crop rotation and fertilizers were introduced soon after the neolithic revolution and developed much further in the past  years starting with the british agricultural revolution
since  agriculture in the developed nations and to a lesser extent in the developing world has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization and assisted by synthetic fertilizers pesticides and selective breeding
the haberbosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale greatly increasing crop yields
modern agriculture has raised social political and environmental issues including overpopulation water pollution biofuels genetically modified organisms tariffs and farm subsidies
in response organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides
scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture
studies of the transition from huntergatherer to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism examples are the natufian culture in the levant and the early chinese neolithic in china
current models indicate that wild stands that had been harvested previously started to be planted but were not immediately domesticated
localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the levant
when major climate change took place after the last ice age c  bc much of the earth became subject to long dry seasons
these conditions favoured annual plants which die off in the long dry season leaving a dormant seed or tuber
an abundance of readily storable wild grains and pulses enabled huntergatherers in some areas to form the first settled villages at this time
early people began altering communities of flora and fauna for their own benefit through means such as firestick farming and forest gardening very early
wild grains have been collected and eaten from at least  years ago and possibly much longer
exact dates are hard to determine as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection
an example is the semitough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the younger dryas about  bc in the early holocene in the levant region of the fertile crescent
monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally
agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included a diverse range of taxa
at least  separate regions of the old and new world were involved as independent centers of origin
some of the earliest known domestications were of animals
domestic pigs had multiple centres of origin in eurasia including europe east asia and southwest asia where wild boar were first domesticated about  years ago
sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between  bc and  bc
cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan around  bc
camels were domesticated late perhaps around  bc
it was not until after  bc that the eight socalled founder crops of agriculture appear first emmer and einkorn wheat then hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax
these eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on prepottery neolithic b ppnb sites in the levant although wheat was the first to be grown and harvested on a significant scale
at around the same time  bc parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated
domesticated rye occurs in small quantities at some neolithic sites in asia minor turkey such as the prepottery neolithic b c  c  bc can hasan iii near  but is otherwise absent until the bronze age of central europe c   bc
claims of much earlier cultivation of rye at the epipalaeolithic site of tell abu hureyra in the euphrates valley of northern syria remain controversial
critics point to inconsistencies in the radiocarbon dates and identifications based solely on grain rather than on chaff
by  bc farming was entrenched on the banks of the nile
about this time agriculture was developed independently in the far east probably in china with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop
maize was domesticated from the wild grass teosinte in west mexico by  bc
the potato  bc tomato pepper  bc squash  bc and several varieties of bean  bc onwards were domesticated in the new world
agriculture was independently developed on the island of new guinea
banana cultivation of musa acuminata including hybridization dates back to  bc and possibly to  bc in papua new guinea
bees were kept for honey in the middle east around  bc
archaeological evidence from various sites on the iberian peninsula suggest the domestication of plants and animals between  and  bc
céide fields in ireland consisting of extensive tracts of land enclosed by stone walls date to  bc and are the oldest known field systems in the world
the horse was domesticated in the pontic steppe around  bc
in siberia cannabis was in use in china in neolithic times and may have been domesticated there it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in ancient egypt by about  bc
in northern china millet was domesticated by early sinotibetan speakers at around  to  bc becoming the main crop of the yellow river basin by  bc
they were followed by mung soy and azuki beans
in southern china rice was domesticated in the yangtze river basin at around  to  bc along with the development of wetland agriculture by early austronesian and hmongmienspeakers
other food plants were also harvested including acorns water chestnuts and foxnuts
rice cultivation was later spread to island southeast asia by the austronesian expansion starting at around  to  bc
this migration event also saw the introduction of cultivated and domesticated food plants from taiwan island southeast asia and new guinea into the pacific islands as canoe plants
contact with sri lanka and southern india by austronesian sailors also led to an exchange of food plants which later became the origin of the valuable spice trade
in the st millennium ad austronesian sailors also settled madagascar and the comoros bringing southeast asian and south asian food plants with them to the east african coast including bananas and rice
rice was also spread southwards into mainland southeast asia by around  to  bc by the migrations of the early austroasiatic and kradaispeakers
in the sahel region of africa sorghum was domesticated by  bc in sudan and pearl millet by  bc in mali
kola nut and coffee were also domesticated in africa
in new guinea ancient papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around  bc domesticating sugarcane and taro
in the indus valley from the eighth millennium bc onwards at mehrgarh row and row barley were cultivated along with einkorn emmer and durum wheats and dates
in the earliest levels of merhgarh wild game such as gazelle swamp deer blackbuck chital wild ass wild goat wild sheep boar and nilgai were all hunted for food
these are successively replaced by domesticated sheep goats and humped zebu cattle by the fifth millennium bc indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture
maize and squash were domesticated in mesoamerica potato in south america and sunflower in the eastern woodlands of north america
sumerian farmers grew the cereals barley and wheat starting to live in villages from about  bc
given the low rainfall of the region agriculture relied on the tigris and euphrates rivers
irrigation canals leading from the rivers permitted the growth of cereals in large enough quantities to support cities
the first ploughs appear in pictographs from uruk around  bc seedploughs that funneled seed into the ploughed furrow appear on seals around  bc
vegetable crops included chickpeas lentils peas beans onions garlic lettuce leeks and mustard
they grew fruits including dates grapes apples melons and figs
alongside their farming sumerians also caught fish and hunted fowl and gazelle
the meat of sheep goats cows and poultry was eaten mainly by the elite
fish was preserved by drying salting and smoking
the civilization of ancient egypt was indebted to the nile river and its dependable seasonal flooding
the rivers predictability and the fertile soil allowed the egyptians to build an empire on the basis of great agricultural wealth
egyptians were among the first peoples to practice agriculture on a large scale starting in the predynastic period from the end of the paleolithic into the neolithic between around  bc and  bc
this was made possible with the development of basin irrigation
their staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus
jujube was domesticated in the indian subcontinent by  bc
barley and wheat cultivation along with the domestication of cattle primarily sheep and goats followed in mehrgarh culture by   bc
this period also saw the first domestication of the elephant
pastoral farming in india included threshing planting crops in rows either of two or of six and storing grain in granaries
cotton was cultivated by the th th millennium bc
by the th millennium bc agricultural communities became widespread in kashmir
irrigation was developed in the indus valley civilization by around  bc
the size and prosperity of the indus civilization grew as a result of this innovation leading to more thoroughly planned settlements which used drainage and sewers
archeological evidence of an animaldrawn plough dates back to  bc in the indus valley civilization
records from the warring states qin dynasty and han dynasty provide a picture of early chinese agriculture from the th century bc to nd century ad which included a nationwide granary system and widespread use of sericulture
an important early chinese book on agriculture is the qimin yaoshu of ad  written by jia sixie
jias writing style was straightforward and lucid relative to the elaborate and allusive writing typical of the time
jias book was also very long with over one hundred thousand written chinese characters and it quoted many other chinese books that were written previously but no longer survive
the contents of jias th century book include sections on land preparation seeding cultivation orchard management forestry and animal husbandry
the book also includes peripherally related content covering trade and culinary uses for crops
the work and the style in which it was written proved influential on later chinese agronomists such as wang zhen and his groundbreaking nong shu of 
for agricultural purposes the chinese had innovated the hydraulicpowered trip hammer by the st century bc
although it found other purposes its main function to pound decorticate and polish grain that otherwise would have been done manually
the chinese also began using the squarepallet chain pump by the st century ad powered by a waterwheel or oxen pulling an on a system of mechanical wheels
although the chain pump found use in public works of providing water for urban and palatial pipe systems it was used largely to lift water from a lower to higher elevation in filling irrigation canals and channels for farmland
by the end of the han dynasty in the late nd century heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards
these slowly spread west revolutionizing farming in northern europe by the th century
thomas glick however argues for a development of the chinese plough as late as the th century implying its spread east from similar designs known in italy by the th century
asian rice was domesticated   years ago in china with a single genetic origin from the wild rice oryza rufipogon in the pearl river valley region of china
rice cultivation then spread to south and southeast asia
the major cereal crops of the ancient mediterranean region were wheat emmer and barley while common vegetables included peas beans fava and olives dairy products came mostly from sheep and goats and meat which was consumed on rare occasion for most people usually consisted of pork beef and lamb
agriculture in ancient greece was hindered by the topography of mainland greece that only allowed for roughly  of the land to be cultivated properly necessitating the specialized exportation of oil and wine and importation of grains from thrace centered in what is now bulgaria and the greek colonies of southern russia
during the hellenistic period the ptolemaic empire controlled egypt cyprus phoenicia and cyrenaica major grainproducing regions that mainland greeks depended on for subsistence while the ptolemaic grain market also played a critical role in the rise of the roman republic
in the seleucid empire mesopotamia was a crucial area for the production of wheat while nomadic animal husbandry was also practiced in other parts
in the grecoroman world of classical antiquity roman agriculture was built on techniques originally pioneered by the sumerians transmitted to them by subsequent cultures with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export
the romans laid the groundwork for the manorial economic system involving serfdom which flourished in the middle ages
the farm sizes in rome can be divided into three categories
small farms were from   iugera one iugerum is equal to about  acre
mediumsized farms were from   iugera singular iugerum
large estates called latifundia were over  iugera
the romans had four systems of farm management direct work by owner and his family slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farms produce and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant
in mesoamerica wild teosinte was transformed through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize more than  years ago
it gradually spread across north america and was the major crop of native americans at the time of european exploration
other mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans while cocoa also domesticated in the region was a major crop
the turkey one of the most important meat birds was probably domesticated in mexico or the us
southwest
in mesoamerica the aztecs were active farmers and had an agriculturally focused economy
the land around lake texcoco was fertile but not large enough to produce the amount of food needed for the population of their expanding empire
the aztecs developed irrigation systems formed terraced hillsides fertilized their soil and developed chinampas or artificial islands also known as floating gardens
the mayas between  bc to  ad used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland on the yucatán peninsula
in the andes region of south america with civilizations including the inca the major crop was the potato domesticated approximately   years ago
coca still a major crop to this day was domesticated in the andes as were the peanut tomato tobacco and pineapple
cotton was domesticated in peru by  bc
animals were also domesticated including llamas alpacas and guinea pigs
guaitecas archipelago in patagonia made up the southern limit of prehispanic agriculture as noted by the mention of the cultivation of chiloé potatoes by a spanish expedition in 
the presence of maize in guaitecas archipelago is also mentioned by early spanish explorers albeit the spanish may have misidentified the plant
the indigenous people of the eastern us domesticated numerous crops
sunflowers tobacco varieties of squash and chenopodium as well as crops no longer grown including marsh elder and little barley were domesticated
wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested
the domesticated strawberry is a hybrid of a chilean and a north american species developed by breeding in europe and north america
two major crops pecans and concord grapes were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but do not appear to have been domesticated until the th century
the indigenous people in what is now california and the pacific northwest practiced various forms of forest gardening and firestick farming in the forests grasslands mixed woodlands and wetlands ensuring that desired food and medicine plants continued to be available
the natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a lowintensity fire ecology which prevented larger catastrophic fires and sustained a lowdensity agriculture in loose rotation a sort of wild permaculture
a system of companion planting called the three sisters was developed in north america
three crops that complemented each other were planted together winter squash maize corn and climbing beans typically tepary beans or common beans
the maize provides a structure for the beans to climb eliminating the need for poles
the beans provide the nitrogen to the soil that the other plants use and the squash spreads along the ground blocking the sunlight helping prevent the establishment of weeds
the squash leaves also act as a living mulch
indigenous australians were nomadic huntergatherers
due to the policy of terra nullius aboriginals were regarded as not having been capable of sustained agriculture
however the current consensus is that various agricultural methods were employed by the indigenous people
in two regions of central australia the central west coast and eastern central australia forms of agriculture were practiced
people living in permanent settlements of over  residents sowed or planted on a large scale and stored the harvested food
the nhanda and amangu of the central west coast grew yams dioscorea hastifolia while various groups in eastern central australia the corners region planted and harvested bush onions yaua cyperus bulbosus native millet cooly tindil panicum decompositum and a sporocarp ngardu marsilea drummondii
indigenous australians used systematic burning firestick farming to enhance natural productivity
in the s and s archaeological research in south west victoria established that the gunditjmara and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly  years
the archaeologist harry lourandos suggested in the s that there was evidence of intensification in progress across australia a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding  years
these concepts led the historian bill gammage to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape
torres islanders are now known to have planted bananas
from  bc to  ad world population continued to grow along with land use as evidenced by the rapid increase in methane emissions from cattle and the cultivation of rice
from the th century the medieval islamic world underwent a transformation in agricultural practice described by the historian andrew watson as the arab agricultural revolution
this transformation was driven by a number of factors including the diffusion of many crops and plants along muslim trade routes the spread of more advanced farming techniques and an agriculturaleconomic system which promoted increased yields and efficiency
the shift in agricultural practice changed the economy population distribution vegetation cover agricultural production population levels urban growth the distribution of the labour force cooking diet and clothing across the islamic world
muslim traders covered much of the old world and trade enabled the diffusion of many crops plants and farming techniques across the region as well as the adaptation of crops plants and techniques from beyond the islamic world
this diffusion introduced major crops to europe by way of alandalus along with the techniques for their cultivation and cuisine
sugar cane rice and cotton were among the major crops transferred along with citrus and other fruit trees nut trees vegetables such as aubergine spinach and chard and the use of imported spices such as cumin coriander nutmeg and cinnamon
intensive irrigation crop rotation and agricultural manuals were widely adopted
irrigation partly based on roman technology made use of noria water wheels water mills dams and reservoirs
the middle ages saw further improvements in agriculture
monasteries spread throughout europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry
the manorial system allowed large landowners to control their land and its laborers in the form of peasants or serfs
during the medieval period the arab world was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the european asia and african continents
besides transporting numerous crops they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to europe and developed the beginnings of the plantation system of sugarcane growing through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation
by ad  developments in iron smelting allowed for increased production in europe leading to developments in the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs hand tools and horse shoes
the carruca heavy plough improved on the earlier scratch plough with the adoption of the chinese mouldboard plough to turn over the heavy wet soils of northern europe
this led to the clearing of northern european forests and an increase in agricultural production which in turn led to an increase in population
at the same time some farmers in europe moved from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year
this resulted in increased productivity and nutrition as the change in rotations permitted nitrogenfixing legumes such as peas lentils and beans
improved horse harnesses and the whippletree further improved cultivation
watermills were introduced by the romans but were improved throughout the middle ages along with windmills and used to grind grains into flour to cut wood and to process flax and wool
crops included wheat rye barley and oats
peas beans and vetches became common from the th century onward as a fodder crop for animals and also for their nitrogenfixation fertilizing properties
crop yields peaked in the th century and stayed more or less steady until the th century
though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the middle ages recent studies have shown that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times such as the terrible weather of   that the needs of the population could not be met
after  a global exchange of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred
maize potatoes sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the new world to the old while varieties of wheat barley rice and turnips traveled from the old world to the new
there had been few livestock species in the new world with horses cattle sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with old world settlers
crops moving in both directions across the atlantic ocean caused population growth around the world and a lasting effect on many cultures in the early modern period
maize and cassava were introduced from brazil into africa by portuguese traders in the th century becoming staple foods replacing native african crops
after its introduction from south america to spain in the late s the potato became a staple crop throughout europe by the late s
the potato allowed farmers to produce more food and initially added variety to the european diet
the increased supply of food reduced disease increased births and reduced mortality causing a population boom throughout the british empire the us and europe
the introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer in the form of guano imported to europe from peru and the first artificial pesticide in the form of an arsenic compound used to fight colorado potato beetles
before the adoption of the potato as a major crop the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed including  major famines in england between  and 
the resulting dependence on the potato however caused the european potato failure a disastrous crop failure from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in ireland alone
between the th century and the midth century britain saw a large increase in agricultural productivity and net output
new agricultural practices like enclosure mechanization fourfield crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to  million in  freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce and thereby helped drive the industrial revolution
the productivity of wheat went up from  us bushels  l  us dry gal  imp gal per acre in  to around  us bushels  l  us dry gal  imp gal by  marking a major turning point in history
advice on more productive techniques for farming began to appear in england in the midth century from writers such as samuel hartlib walter blith and others
the main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients most importantly nitrogen levels in the soil
to allow the soil to regenerate productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used
the dutch fourfield rotation system was popularised by the british agriculturist charles townshend in the th century
the system wheat turnips barley and clover opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred yearround
the use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates
the mechanisation and rationalisation of agriculture was another important factor
robert bakewell and thomas coke introduced selective breeding and initiated a process of inbreeding to maximise desirable traits from the mid th century such as the new leicester sheep
machines were invented to improve the efficiency of various agricultural operation such as jethro tulls seed drill of  that mechanised seeding at the correct depth and spacing and andrew meikles threshing machine of 
ploughs were steadily improved from joseph foljambes rotherham iron plough in  to james smalls improved scots plough metal in 
in ransomes sims jefferies was producing  plough models for different soils
powered farm machinery began with richard trevithicks stationary steam engine used to drive a threshing machine in 
mechanisation spread to other farm uses through the th century
the first petroldriven tractor was built in america by john froelich in 
john bennet lawes began the scientific investigation of fertilization at the rothamsted experimental station in 
he investigated the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield and founded one of the first artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 
fertilizer in the shape of sodium nitrate deposits in chile was imported to britain by john thomas north as well as guano birds droppings
the first commercial process for fertilizer production was the obtaining of phosphate from the dissolution of coprolites in sulphuric acid
dan albone constructed the first commercially successful gasolinepowered general purpose tractor in  and the  international harvester farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals particularly horses with machines
since that time selfpropelled mechanical harvesters combines planters transplanters and other equipment have been developed further revolutionizing agriculture
these inventions allowed farming tasks to be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of highquality produce per land unit
the haberbosch method for synthesizing ammonium nitrate represented a major breakthrough and allowed crop yields to overcome previous constraints
it was first patented by german chemist fritz haber
in  carl bosch while working for german chemical company basf successfully commercialized the process and secured further patents
in the years after world war ii the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly in sync with the increasing world population
collective farming was widely practiced in the soviet union the eastern bloc countries china and vietnam starting in the s in the soviet union one result was the soviet famine of  
another consequence occurred during the great leap forward in china initiated by mao tsetung that resulted in the great chinese famine from  and ultimately reshaped the thinking of deng xiaoping
in the past century agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour water pollution and farm subsidies
other applications of scientific research since  in agriculture include gene manipulation hydroponics and the development of economically viable biofuels such as ethanol
the number of people involved in farming in industrial countries fell radically from  percent of the american population to  percent in 
the number of farms also decreased and their ownership became more concentrated for example between  and  one million pig farms in america consolidated into  with  percent of the production on factory farms
according to the worldwatch institute  percent of the worlds poultry  percent of beef and  percent of eggs are produced this way
famines however continued to sweep the globe through the th century
through the effects of climactic events government policy war and crop failure millions of people died in each of at least ten famines between the s and the s
the historical processes that have allowed agricultural crops to be cultivated and eaten well beyond their centers of origin continues in the present through globalization
on average  of a nations food supplies and  of its agricultural production are of crops with foreign origins
the green revolution was a series of research development and technology transfer initiatives between the s and the late s
it increased agriculture production around the world especially from the late s
the initiatives led by norman borlaug and credited with saving over a billion people from starvation involved the development of highyielding varieties of cereal grains expansion of irrigation infrastructure modernization of management techniques distribution of hybridized seeds synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to farmers
synthetic nitrogen along with mined rock phosphate pesticides and mechanization have greatly increased crop yields in the early th century
increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well
further global yield increases were experienced later in the th century when highyield varieties of common staple grains such as rice wheat and corn were introduced as a part of the green revolution
the green revolution exported the technologies including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen of the developed world to the developing world
thomas malthus famously predicted that the earth would not be able to support its growing population but technologies such as the green revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food
although the green revolution at first significantly increased rice yields in asia yield then levelled off
the genetic yield potential has increased for wheat but the yield potential for rice has not increased since  and the yield potential for maize has barely increased in  years
it takes only a decade or two for herbicideresistant weeds to emerge and insects become resistant to insecticides within about a decade delayed somewhat by crop rotation
for most of its history agriculture has been organic without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides and without gmos
with the advent of chemical agriculture rudolf steiner called for farming without synthetic pesticides and his agriculture course of  laid the foundation for biodynamic agriculture
lord northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic farming in 
this became a worldwide movement and organic farming is now practiced in many countries
intensive agriculture also known as intensive farming as opposed to extensive farming and industrial agriculture is a type of agriculture both of crop plants and of animals with higher levels of input and output per unit of agricultural land area
it is characterized by a low fallow ratio higher use of inputs such as capital and labour and higher crop yields per unit land area
most commercial agriculture is intensive in one or more ways
forms that rely heavily on industrial methods are often called industrial agriculture which is characterised by innovations designed to increase yield
techniques include planting multiple crops per year reducing the frequency of fallow years and improving cultivars
it also involves increased use of fertilizers plant growth regulators and pesticides and mechanised agriculture controlled by increased and more detailed analysis of growing conditions including weather soil water weeds and pests
intensive farms are widespread in developed nations and increasingly prevalent worldwide
most of the meat dairy products eggs fruits and vegetables available in supermarkets are produced by such farms
some intensive farms can use sustainable methods although this may necessitate higher inputs of labor or lower yields
sustainably increasing agricultural productivity especially on smallholdings is an important way of decreasing the amount of land needed for farming and slowing environmental degradation through processes like deforestation
since agriculture has such large impacts on climate change project drawdown described sustainable intensification for smallholders an important method for climate change mitigation
intensive animal farming involves large numbers of animals raised on limited land for example by rotational grazing or in the western world sometimes as concentrated animal feeding operations
these methods increase the yields of food and fiber per acre as compared to extensive animal husbandry concentrated feed is brought to seldommoved animals or with rotational grazing the animals are repeatedly moved to fresh forage
paddybased ricefarming has been practised in korea since ancient times
a pithouse at the daecheonni archaeological site yielded carbonized rice grains and radiocarbon dates indicating that rice cultivation may have begun as early as the middle jeulmun pottery period c   bc in the korean peninsula
the earliest rice cultivation there may have used dryfields instead of paddies
agricultural development in britain between the th century and the midth century saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and net output
this in turn contributed to unprecedented population growth freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce and thereby helped enable the industrial revolution
historians cited enclosure mechanization fourfield crop rotation and selective breeding as the most important innovations
industrial agriculture arose in the industrial revolution
by the early th century agricultural techniques implements seed stocks and cultivars had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the middle ages

the industrialization phase involved a continuing process of mechanization
horsedrawn machinery such as the mccormick reaper revolutionized harvesting while inventions such as the cotton gin reduced the cost of processing
during this same period farmers began to use steampowered threshers and tractors
in  the first gasolinepowered tractor was successfully developed and in  the international harvester farmall tractor became the first allpurpose tractor marking an inflection point in the replacement of draft animals with machines
mechanical harvesters combines planters transplanters and other equipment were then developed further revolutionizing agriculture
these inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage increasingly large farms
the identification of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium npk as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers further increasing crop yields
in the haberbosch method to synthesize ammonium nitrate was first demonstrated
npk fertilizers stimulated the first concerns about industrial agriculture due to concerns that they came with side effects such as soil compaction soil erosion and declines in overall soil fertility along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply
the discovery of vitamins and their role in nutrition in the first two decades of the th century led to vitamin supplements which in the s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements
citation needed
following world war ii synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly
the discovery of antibiotics and vaccines facilitated raising livestock by reducing diseases
citation needed developments in logistics and refrigeration as well as processing technology made longdistance distribution feasible
integrated pest management is the modern method to minimize pesticide use to more sustainable levels
citation needed
there are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides which has given rise to the organic movement and has built a market for sustainable intensive farming as well as funding for the development of appropriate technology
pasture intensification is the improvement of pasture soils and grasses to increase the food production potential of livestock systems
it is commonly used to reverse pasture degradation a process characterized by loss of forage and decreased animal carrying capacity which results from overgrazing poor nutrient management and lack of soil conservation
this degradation leads to poor pasture soils with decreased fertility and water availability and increased rates of erosion compaction and acidification
degraded pastures have significantly lower productivity and higher carbon footprints compared to intensified pastures
management practices which improve soil health and consequently grass productivity include irrigation soil scarification and the application of lime fertilizers and pesticides
depending on the productivity goals of the target agricultural system more involved restoration projects can be undertaken to replace invasive and underproductive grasses with grass species that are better suited to the soil and climate conditions of the region
these intensified grass systems allow higher stocking rates with faster animal weight gain and reduced time to slaughter resulting in more productive carbonefficient livestock systems
another technique to optimize yield while maintaining the carbon balance is the use of integrated croplivestock icl and croplivestockforestry iclf systems which combine several ecosystems into one optimized agricultural framework
these synergies between these systems provide benefits to pastures through optimal plant usage improved feed and fattening rates increased soil fertility and quality intensified nutrient cycling integrated pest control and improved biodiversity
the introduction of certain legume crops to pastures increases carbon accumulation and nitrogen fixation in soils while their digestibility helps animal fattening and reduces methane emissions from enteric fermentation
iclf systems yield beef cattle productivity up to ten times that of degraded pastures additional crop production from maize sorghum and soybean harvests and greatly reduced greenhouse gas balances due to forest carbon sequestration
in the twelve aprils grazing program for dairy production developed by the usdasare forage crops for dairy herds are planted into a perennial pasture
rotational grazing is a variety of foraging in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh rested grazing areas sometimes called paddocks to maximize the quality and quantity of forage growth
it can be used with cattle sheep goats pigs chickens turkeys ducks and other animals
the herds graze one portion of pasture or a paddock while allowing the others to recover
resting grazed lands allows the vegetation to renew energy reserves rebuild shoot systems and deepen root systems resulting in longterm maximum biomass production
pasture systems alone can allow grazers to meet their energy requirements but rotational grazing is especially effective because grazers thrive on the more tender younger plant stems
parasites are also left behind to die off minimizing or eliminating the need for dewormers
with the increased productivity of rotational systems the animals may need less supplemental feed than in continuous grazing systems
farmers can therefore increase stocking rates
intensive livestock farming or factory farming is the process of raising livestock in confinement at high stocking density
concentrated animal feeding operations cafo or intensive livestock operations can hold large numbers some up to hundreds of thousands of cows hogs turkeys or chickens often indoors
the essence of such farms is the concentration of livestock in a given space
the aim is to provide maximum output at the lowest possible cost and with the greatest level of food safety
the term is often used pejoratively
cafos have dramatically increased the production of food from animal husbandry worldwide both in terms of total food produced and efficiency
food and water is delivered to the animals and therapeutic use of antimicrobial agents vitamin supplements and growth hormones are often employed
growth hormones are not used on chickens nor on any animal in the european union
undesirable behaviors often related to the stress of confinement led to a search for docile breeds eg with natural dominant behaviors bred out physical restraints to stop interaction such as individual cages for chickens or physical modification such as the debeaking of chickens to reduce the harm of fighting

the cafo designation resulted from the  us federal clean water act which was enacted to protect and restore lakes and rivers to a fishable swimmable quality
the united states environmental protection agency identified certain animal feeding operations along with many other types of industry as point source groundwater polluters
these operations were subjected to regulation
in  states in the us isolated cases of groundwater contamination were linked to cafos
for example the ten million hogs in north carolina generate  million tons of waste per year
the us federal government acknowledges the waste disposal issue and requires that animal waste be stored in lagoons
these lagoons can be as large as  acres  m
lagoons not protected with an impermeable liner can leak into groundwater under some conditions as can runoff from manure used as fertilizer
a lagoon that burst in  released  million gallons of nitrous sludge in north carolinas new river
the spill allegedly killed eight to ten million fish
the large concentration of animals animal waste and dead animals in a small space poses ethical issues to some consumers
animal rights and animal welfare activists have charged that intensive animal rearing is cruel to animals
the green revolution transformed farming in many developing countries
it spread technologies that had already existed but had not been widely used outside of industrialized nations
these technologies included miracle seeds pesticides irrigation and synthetic nitrogen fertilizer
in the s scientists created highyielding varieties of maize wheat and rice
these have an increased nitrogenabsorbing potential compared to other varieties
since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge fall over before harvest semidwarfing genes were bred into their genomes
norin  wheat a variety developed by orville vogel from japanese dwarf wheat varieties was instrumental in developing wheat cultivars
ir the first widely implemented highyielding rice to be developed by the international rice research institute was created through a cross between an indonesian variety named peta and a chinese variety named dee geo woo gen
with the availability of molecular genetics in arabidopsis and rice the mutant genes responsible reduced height rht gibberellin insensitive gai and slender rice slr have been cloned and identified as cellular signalling components of gibberellic acid a phytohormone involved in regulating stem growth via its effect on cell division
photosynthate investment in the stem is reduced dramatically in shorter plants and nutrients become redirected to grain production amplifying in particular the yield effect of chemical fertilizers
highyielding varieties outperformed traditional varieties several fold and responded better to the addition of irrigation pesticides and fertilizers
hybrid vigour is utilized in many important crops to greatly increase yields for farmers
however the advantage is lost for the progeny of the f hybrids meaning seeds for annual crops need to be purchased every season thus increasing costs and profits for farmers
crop rotation or crop sequencing is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same space in sequential seasons for benefits such as avoiding pathogen and pest buildup that occurs when one species is continuously cropped
crop rotation also seeks to balance the nutrient demands of various crops to avoid soil nutrient depletion
a traditional component of crop rotation is the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of legumes and green manure in sequence with cereals and other crops
crop rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deeprooted and shallowrooted plants
a related technique is to plant multispecies cover crops between commercial crops
this combines the advantages of intensive farming with continuous cover and polyculture
crop irrigation accounts for  of the worlds fresh water use
flood irrigation the oldest and most common type is typically unevenly distributed as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts
overhead irrigation using centerpivot or lateralmoving sprinklers gives a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern
drip irrigation is the most expensive and leastused type but delivers water to plant roots with minimal losses
water catchment management measures include recharge pits which capture rainwater and runoff and use it to recharge groundwater supplies
this helps in the replenishment of groundwater wells and eventually reduces soil erosion
dammed rivers creating reservoirs store water for irrigation and other uses over large areas
smaller areas sometimes use irrigation ponds or groundwater
in agriculture systematic weed management is usually required often performed by machines such as cultivators or liquid herbicide sprayers
herbicides kill specific targets while leaving the crop relatively unharmed
some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant hormones
weed control through herbicide is made more difficult when the weeds become resistant to the herbicide
solutions include
in agriculture a terrace is a leveled section of a hilly cultivated area designed as a method of soil conservation to slow or prevent the rapid surface runoff of irrigation water
often such land is formed into multiple terraces giving a stepped appearance
the human landscapes of rice cultivation in terraces that follow the natural contours of the escarpments like contour ploughing are a classic feature of the island of bali and the banaue rice terraces in banaue ifugao philippines
in peru the inca made use of otherwise unusable slopes by building drystone walls to create terraces

a paddy field is a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing rice and other semiaquatic crops
paddy fields are a typical feature of ricegrowing countries of east and southeast asia including malaysia china sri lanka myanmar thailand korea japan vietnam taiwan indonesia india and the philippines
they are also found in other ricegrowing regions such as piedmont italy the camargue france and the artibonite valley haiti
they can occur naturally along rivers or marshes or can be constructed even on hillsides
they require large water quantities for irrigation much of it from flooding
it gives an environment favourable to the strain of rice being grown and is hostile to many species of weeds
as the only draft animal species which is comfortable in wetlands the water buffalo is in widespread use in asian rice paddies
a recent development in the intensive production of rice is the system of rice intensification
developed in  by the french jesuit father henri de laulanié in madagascar by  the number of smallholder farmers using the system had grown to between  and  million
aquaculture is the cultivation of the natural products of water fish shellfish algae seaweed and other aquatic organisms
intensive aquaculture takes place on land using tanks ponds or other controlled systems or in the ocean using cages
intensive farming practices which are thought to be sustainable have been developed to slow the deterioration of agricultural land and even regenerate soil health and ecosystem services
these developments may fall in the category of organic farming or the integration of organic and conventional agriculture
pasture cropping involves planting grain crops directly into grassland without first applying herbicides
the perennial grasses form a living mulch understory to the grain crop eliminating the need to plant cover crops after harvest
the pasture is intensively grazed both before and after grain production
this intensive system yields equivalent farmer profits partly from increased livestock forage while building new topsoil and sequestering up to  tons of cohayear
biointensive agriculture focuses on maximizing efficiency such as per unit area energy input and water input
agroforestry combines agriculture and orchardforestry technologies to create more integrated diverse productive profitable healthy and sustainable landuse systems
intercropping can increase yields or reduce inputs and thus represents potentially sustainable agricultural intensification
however while total yield per acre is often increased yields of any single crop often diminish
there are also challenges to farmers relying on farming equipment optimized for monoculture often resulting in increased labor inputs
vertical farming is intensive crop production on a large scale in urban centers in multistory artificiallylit structures for the production of lowcalorie foods like herbs microgreens and lettuce
an integrated farming system is a progressive sustainable agriculture system such as zero waste agriculture or integrated multitrophic aquaculture which involves the interactions of multiple species
elements of this integration can include
holistic management was originally developed for reversing desertification
holistic planned grazing is similar to rotational grazing but accentuates the four principles of the water cycle the mineral cycles including the carbon cycle energy flow and ecology
when huntergatherers with growing populations depleted the stocks of game and wild foods across the near east they were forced to introduce agriculture
but agriculture brought much longer hours of work and a less rich diet than huntergatherers enjoyed
further population growth among shifting slashandburn farmers led to shorter fallow periods falling yields and soil erosion
plowing and fertilizers were introduced to deal with these problems but once again involved longer hours of work and degradation of soil resources
the challenges and issues of industrial agriculture for society for the sector and for animal rights include the costs and benefits of both current practices and proposed changes to those practices
this is a continuation of thousands of years of invention in feeding growing populations
very roughly
between  and  us agricultural productivity output divided by all inputs rose by an average of about  percent annually causing food prices to decrease
the percentage of us disposable income spent on food prepared at home decreased from  percent as late as  to  percent by the end of the century
industrial agriculture uses huge amounts of water energy and industrial chemicals increasing pollution in the arable land usable water and atmosphere
herbicides insecticides and fertilizers accumulate in ground and surface waters
industrial agricultural practices are one of the main drivers of global warming accounting for   of net greenhousegas emissions
many of the negative effects of industrial agriculture may emerge at some distance from fields and farms
nitrogen compounds from the midwest for example travel down the mississippi to degrade coastal fisheries in the gulf of mexico causing socalled oceanic dead zones
but other adverse effects show up within agricultural production systems for example the rapidly developing resistance among pests renders herbicides and insecticides increasingly ineffective
agrochemicals have been implicatedby whom
in colony collapse disorder in which the individual members of bee colonies disappear
agricultural production is highly dependent on bees to pollinate many varieties of fruits and vegetables
intensive monoculture increases the risk of failures due to pests adverse weather and disease
a study for the us office of technology assessment concluded that regarding industrial agriculture there is a negative relationship between the trend toward increasing farm size and the social conditions in rural communities on a statistical level
agricultural monoculture can entail social and economic risks
plant breeding is the science of changing the traits of plants in order to produce desired characteristics
it has been used to improve the quality of nutrition in products for humans and animals
the goals of plant breeding are to produce crop varieties that boast unique and superior traits for a variety of agricultural applications
the most frequently addressed traits are those related to biotic and abiotic stress tolerance grain or biomass yield enduse quality characteristics such as taste or the concentrations of specific biological molecules proteins sugars lipids vitamins fibers and ease of processing harvesting milling baking malting blending etc
plant breeding can be accomplished through many different techniques ranging from simply selecting plants with desirable characteristics for propagation to methods that make use of knowledge of genetics and chromosomes to more complex molecular techniques see cultigen and cultivar
genes in a plant are what determine what type of qualitative or quantitative traits it will have
plant breeders strive to create a specific outcome of plants and potentially new plant varieties
it is practiced worldwide by individuals such as gardeners and farmers and by professional plant breeders employed by organizations such as government institutions universities cropspecific industry associations or research centers
international development agencies believe that breeding new crops is important for ensuring food security by developing new varieties that are higher yielding disease resistant drought tolerant or regionally adapted to different environments and growing conditions
plant breeding started with sedentary agriculture and particularly the domestication of the first agricultural plants a practice which is estimated to date back  to  years
initially early farmers simply selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics and employed these as progenitors for subsequent generations resulting in an accumulation of valuable traits over time
grafting technology had been practiced in china before  bce
by bce grafting was well established and practiced
gregor mendel   is considered the father of genetics
his experiments with plant hybridization led to his establishing laws of inheritance
genetics stimulated research to improve crop production through plant breeding
modern plant breeding is applied genetics but its scientific basis is broader covering molecular biology cytology systematics physiology pathology entomology chemistry and statistics biometrics
it has also developed its own technology
one major technique of plant breeding is selection the process of selectively propagating plants with desirable characteristics and eliminating or culling those with less desirable characteristics
another technique is the deliberate interbreeding crossing of closely or distantly related individuals to produce new crop varieties or lines with desirable properties
plants are crossbred to introduce traitsgenes from one variety or line into a new genetic background
for example a mildewresistant pea may be crossed with a highyielding but susceptible pea the goal of the cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the highyield characteristics
progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the highyielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the highyielding parent backcrossing
the progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield selection as described above and mildew resistance and highyielding resistant plants would be further developed
plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce inbred varieties for breeding
pollinators may be excluded through the use of pollination bags
classical breeding relies largely on homologous recombination between chromosomes to generate genetic diversity
the classical plant breeder may also make use of a number of in vitro techniques such as protoplast fusion embryo rescue or mutagenesis see below to generate diversity and produce hybrid plants that would not exist in nature
traits that breeders have tried to incorporate into crop plants include
successful commercial plant breeding concerns were founded from the late th century
clarification needed gartons agricultural plant breeders in england was established in the s by john garton who was one of the first to commercialize new varieties of agricultural crops created through crosspollination
the firms first introduction was abundance oat one of the first agricultural grain varieties bred from a controlled cross introduced to commerce in 
in the early th century plant breeders realized that mendels findings on the nonrandom nature of inheritance could be applied to seedling populations produced through deliberate pollinations to predict the frequencies of different types
wheat hybrids were bred to increase the crop production of italy during the socalled battle for grain  
heterosis was explained by george harrison shull
it describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents
the detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed
maize was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids
statistical methods were also developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment
in  another important breeding technique cytoplasmic male sterility cms developed in maize was described by marcus morton rhoades
cms is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile pollen
this enables the production of hybrids without the need for laborintensive detasseling
these early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the united states in the early th century
similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after world war ii the green revolution increased crop production in the developing world in the s
following world war ii a number of techniques were developed that allowed plant breeders to hybridize distantly related species and artificially induce genetic diversity
when distantly related species are crossed plant breeders make use of a number of plant tissue culture techniques to produce progeny from otherwise fruitless mating
interspecific and intergeneric hybrids are produced from a cross of related species or genera that do not normally sexually reproduce with each other
these crosses are referred to as wide crosses
for example the cereal triticale is a wheat and rye hybrid
the cells in the plants derived from the first generation created from the cross contained an uneven number of chromosomes and as a result was sterile
the cell division inhibitor colchicine was used to double the number of chromosomes in the cell and thus allow the production of a fertile line
failure to produce a hybrid may be due to pre or postfertilization incompatibility
if fertilization is possible between two species or genera the hybrid embryo may abort before maturation
if this does occur the embryo resulting from an interspecific or intergeneric cross can sometimes be rescued and cultured to produce a whole plant
such a method is referred to as embryo rescue
this technique has been used to produce new rice for africa an interspecific cross of asian rice oryza sativa and african rice oryza glaberrima
hybrids may also be produced by a technique called protoplast fusion
in this case protoplasts are fused usually in an electric field
viable recombinants can be regenerated in culture
chemical mutagens like ems and dms radiation and transposons are used to generate mutants with desirable traits to be bred with other cultivars a process known as mutation breeding
classical plant breeders also generate genetic diversity within a species by exploiting a process called somaclonal variation which occurs in plants produced from tissue culture particularly plants derived from callus
induced polyploidy and the addition or removal of chromosomes using a technique called chromosome engineering may also be used
when a desirable trait has been bred into a species a number of crosses to the favored parent are made to make the new plant as similar to the favored parent as possible
returning to the example of the mildew resistant pea being crossed with a highyielding but susceptible pea to make the mildew resistant progeny of the cross most like the highyielding parent the progeny will be crossed back to that parent for several generations see backcrossing
this process removes most of the genetic contribution of the mildew resistant parent
classical breeding is therefore a cyclical process
with classical breeding techniques the breeder does not know exactly what genes have been introduced to the new cultivars
some scientists therefore argue that plants produced by classical breeding methods should undergo the same safety testing regime as genetically modified plants
there have been instances where plants bred using classical techniques have been unsuitable for human consumption for example the poison solanine was unintentionally increased to unacceptable levels in certain varieties of potato through plant breeding
new potato varieties are often screened for solanine levels before reaching the marketplace
modern plant breeding may use techniques of molecular biology to select or in the case of genetic modification to insert desirable traits into plants
application of biotechnology or molecular biology is also known as molecular breeding
sometimes many different genes can influence a desirable trait in plant breeding
the use of tools such as molecular markers or dna fingerprinting can map thousands of genes
this allows plant breeders to screen large populations of plants for those that possess the trait of interest
the screening is based on the presence or absence of a certain gene as determined by laboratory procedures rather than on the visual identification of the expressed trait in the plant
the purpose of marker assisted selection or plant genome analysis is to identify the location and function phenotype of various genes within the genome
if all of the genes are identified it leads to genome sequence
citation neededclarification needed all plants have varying sizes and lengths of genomes with genes that code for different proteins but many are also the same
if a genes location and function is identified in one plant species a very similar gene likely can also be found in a similar location in another related species genome
clarification neededhomozygous plants with desirable traits can be produced from heterozygous starting plants if a haploid cell with the alleles for those traits can be produced and then used to make a doubled haploid
the doubled haploid will be homozygous for the desired traits
furthermore two different homozygous plants created in that way can be used to produce a generation of f hybrid plants which have the advantages of heterozygosity and a greater range of possible traits
thus an individual heterozygous plant chosen for its desirable characteristics can be converted into a heterozygous variety f hybrid without the necessity of vegetative reproduction but as the result of the cross of two homozygousdoubled haploid lines derived from the originally selected plant
plant tissue culturing can produce haploid or double haploid plant lines and generations
this cuts down the genetic diversity taken from that plant species in order to select for desirable traits that will increase the fitness of the individuals
using this method decreases the need for breeding multiple generations of plants to get a generation that is homogenous for the desired traits thereby saving much time over the natural version of the same process
there are many plant tissue culturing techniques that can be used to achieve haploid plants but microspore culturing is currently the most promising for producing the largest numbers of them
genetic modification of plants is achieved by adding a specific gene or genes to a plant or by knocking down a gene with rnai to produce a desirable phenotype
the plants resulting from adding a gene are often referred to as transgenic plants
if for genetic modification genes of the species or of a crossable plant are used under control of their native promoter then they are called cisgenic plants
sometimes genetic modification can produce a plant with the desired trait or traits faster than classical breeding because the majority of the plants genome is not altered
to genetically modify a plant a genetic construct must be designed so that the gene to be added or removed will be expressed by the plant
to do this a promoter to drive transcription and a termination sequence to stop transcription of the new gene and the gene or genes of interest must be introduced to the plant
a marker for the selection of transformed plants is also included
in the laboratory antibiotic resistance is a commonly used marker plants that have been successfully transformed will grow on media containing antibiotics plants that have not been transformed will die
in some instances markers for selection are removed by backcrossing with the parent plant prior to commercial release
the construct can be inserted in the plant genome by genetic recombination using the bacteria agrobacterium tumefaciens or a rhizogenes or by direct methods like the gene gun or microinjection
using plant viruses to insert genetic constructs into plants is also a possibility but the technique is limited by the host range of the virus
for example cauliflower mosaic virus camv only infects cauliflower and related species
another limitation of viral vectors is that the virus is not usually passed on to the progeny so every plant has to be inoculated
the majority of commercially released transgenic plants are currently limited to plants that have introduced resistance to insect pests and herbicides
insect resistance is achieved through incorporation of a gene from bacillus thuringiensis bt that encodes a protein that is toxic to some insects
for example the cotton bollworm a common cotton pest feeds on bt cotton it will ingest the toxin and die
herbicides usually work by binding to certain plant enzymes and inhibiting their action
the enzymes that the herbicide inhibits are known as the herbicides target site
herbicide resistance can be engineered into crops by expressing a version of target site protein that is not inhibited by the herbicide
this is the method used to produce glyphosate resistant roundup ready crop plants
genetic modification can further increase yields by increasing stress tolerance to a given environment
stresses such as temperature variation are signalled to the plant via a cascade of signalling molecules which will activate a transcription factor to regulate gene expression
overexpression of particular genes involved in cold acclimation has been shown to produce more resistance to freezing which is one common cause of yield loss
genetic modification of plants that can produce pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals sometimes called pharming is a rather radical new area of plant breeding
modern plant breeding whether classical or through genetic engineering comes with issues of concern particularly with regard to food crops
the question of whether breeding can have a negative effect on nutritional value is central in this respect
although relatively little direct research in this area has been done there are scientific indications that by favoring certain aspects of a plants development other aspects may be retarded
a study published in the journal of the american college of nutrition in  entitled changes in usda food composition data for  garden crops  to  compared nutritional analysis of vegetables done in  and in  and found substantial decreases in six of  nutrients measured including  of protein and  of riboflavin
reductions in calcium phosphorus iron and ascorbic acid were also found
the study conducted at the biochemical institute university of texas at austin concluded in summary we suggest that any real declines are generally most easily explained by changes in cultivated varieties between  and  in which there may be tradeoffs between yield and nutrient content
the debate surrounding genetically modified food during the s peaked in  in terms of media coverage and risk perception and continues today for example germany has thrown its weight behind a growing european mutiny over genetically modified crops by banning the planting of a widely grown pestresistant corn variety
the debate encompasses the ecological impact of genetically modified plants the safety of genetically modified food and concepts used for safety evaluation like substantial equivalence
such concerns are not new to plant breeding
most countries have regulatory processes in place to help ensure that new crop varieties entering the marketplace are both safe and meet farmers needs
examples include variety registration seed schemes regulatory authorizations for gm plants etc
plant breeders rights is also a major and controversial issue
today production of new varieties is dominated by commercial plant breeders who seek to protect their work and collect royalties through national and international agreements based in intellectual property rights
the range of related issues is complex
in the simplest terms critics of the increasingly restrictive regulations argue that through a combination of technical and economic pressures commercial breeders are reducing biodiversity and significantly constraining individuals such as farmers from developing and trading seed on a regional level
 efforts to strengthen breeders rights for example by lengthening periods of variety protection are ongoing

when new plant breeds or cultivars are bred they must be maintained and propagated
some plants are propagated by asexual means while others are propagated by seeds
seed propagated cultivars require specific control over seed source and production procedures to maintain the integrity of the plant breeds results
isolation is necessary to prevent cross contamination with related plants or the mixing of seeds after harvesting
isolation is normally accomplished by planting distance but in certain crops plants are enclosed in greenhouses or cages most commonly used when producing f hybrids
critics of organic agriculture claim it is too lowyielding to be a viable alternative to conventional agriculture
however part of that poor performance may be the result of growing poorly adapted varieties
it is estimated that over  of organic agriculture is based on conventionally adapted varieties even though the production environments found in organic vs conventional farming systems are vastly different due to their distinctive management practices
most notably organic farmers have fewer inputs available than conventional growers to control their production environments
breeding varieties specifically adapted to the unique conditions of organic agriculture is critical for this sector to realize its full potential
this requires selection for traits such as
currently few breeding programs are directed at organic agriculture and until recently those that did address this sector have generally relied on indirect selection ie
selection in conventional environments for traits considered important for organic agriculture
however because the difference between organic and conventional environments is large a given genotype may perform very differently in each environment due to an interaction between genes and the environment see geneenvironment interaction
if this interaction is severe enough an important trait required for the organic environment may not be revealed in the conventional environment which can result in the selection of poorly adapted individuals
to ensure the most adapted varieties are identified advocates of organic breeding now promote the use of direct selection ie
selection in the target environment for many agronomic traits
there are many classical and modern breeding techniques that can be utilized for crop improvement in organic agriculture despite the ban on genetically modified organisms
for instance controlled crosses between individuals allow desirable genetic variation to be recombined and transferred to seed progeny via natural processes
marker assisted selection can also be employed as a diagnostics tool to facilitate selection of progeny who possess the desired traits greatly speeding up the breeding process
this technique has proven particularly useful for the introgression of resistance genes into new backgrounds as well as the efficient selection of many resistance genes pyramided into a single individual
unfortunately molecular markers are not currently available for many important traits especially complex ones controlled by many genes
for agriculture to thrive in the future changes must be made to address arising global issues
these issues are the lack of arable land increasingly harsh cropping conditions and the need to maintain food security which involves being able to provide the world population with sufficient nutrition
crops need to be able to mature in multiple environments to allow worldwide access which involves solving problems including drought tolerance
it has been suggested that global solutions are achievable through the process of plant breeding with its ability to select specific genes allowing crops to perform at a level which yields the desired results
with an increasing population the production of food needs to increase with it
it is estimated that a  increase in food production is needed by  in order to meet the declaration of the world summit on food security
but with the degradation of agricultural land simply planting more crops is no longer a viable option
new varieties of plants can in some cases be developed through plant breeding that generate an increase of yield without relying on an increase in land area
an example of this can be seen in asia where food production per capita has increased twofold
this has been achieved through not only the use of fertilisers but through the use of better crops that have been specifically designed for the area
plant breeding can contribute to global food security as it is a costeffective tool for increasing nutritional value of forage and crops
improvements in nutritional value for forage crops from the use of analytical chemistry and rumen fermentation technology have been recorded since  this science and technology gave breeders the ability to screen thousands of samples within a small amount of time meaning breeders could identify a high performing hybrid quicker
the genetic improvement was mainly in vitro dry matter digestibility ivdmd resulting in  increase at just  increase in ivdmd a single bos taurus also known as beef cattle reported  increase in daily gains
this improvement indicates plant breeding is an essential tool in gearing future agriculture to perform at a more advanced level
plant breeding of hybrid crops has become extremely popular worldwide in an effort to combat the harsh environment
with long periods of drought and lack of water or nitrogen stress tolerance has become a significant part of agriculture
clarification needed plant breeders have focused on identifying crops which will ensure crops perform under these conditions a way to achieve this is finding strains of the crop that is resistance to drought conditions with low nitrogen
it is evident from this that plant breeding is vital for future agriculture to survive as it enables farmers to produce stress resistant crops hence improving food security
in countries that experience harsh winters such as iceland germany and further east in europe plant breeders are involved in breeding for tolerance to frost continuous snowcover frostdrought desiccation from wind and solar radiation under frost and high moisture levels in soil in winter
participatory plant breeding ppb is when farmers are involved in a crop improvement programme with opportunities to make decisions and contribute to the research process at different stages
participatory approaches to crop improvement can also be applied when plant biotechnologies are being used for crop improvement
local agricultural systems and genetic diversity are developed and strengthened by crop improvement which participatory crop improvement pci plays a large role
ppb is enhanced by farmers knowledge of the quality required and evaluation of target environment which affects the effectiveness of ppb
subsistence agriculture occurs when farmers grow food crops to meet the needs of themselves and their families on smallholdings
subsistence agriculturalists target farm output for survival and for mostly local requirements with little or no surplus
planting decisions occur principally with an eye toward what the family will need during the coming year and only secondarily toward market prices
tony waters writes subsistence peasants are people who grow what they eat build their own houses and live without regularly making purchases in the marketplace
despite the primacy of selfsufficiency in subsistence farming todayupdate most subsistence farmers also participate in trade to some degree though usually for goods that are not necessary for survival which may include sugar iron roofingsheets bicycles used clothing and so forth
most subsistence farmers today operate in developing countries
although their amount of trade as measured in cash is less than that of consumers in countries with modern complex markets many have important trade contacts and trade items that they can produce because of their special skills or special access to resources valued in the marketplace
subsistence agriculture generally features small capitalfinance requirements mixed cropping limited use of agrochemicals eg
pesticides and fertilizer unimproved varieties of crops and animals little or no surplus yield for sale use of crudetraditional tools eg
hoes machetes and cutlasses mainly the production of food crops performed on small scattered plots of land reliance on unskilled labour often family members and generally low yields
subsistence agriculture was the dominant mode of production in the world until recently when marketbased capitalism became widespread
subsistence agriculture had largely disappeared in europe by the beginning of world war i and in north america with the movement of sharecroppers and tenant farmers out of the american south and midwest during the s and s
in central and eastern europe subsistence and semisubsistence agriculture reappeared within the transition economy since about 
subsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural africa and parts of asia and latin america
in  about  billion people slightly more than  of the worlds population in  million households living in rural areas of developing nations survive as smallholder farmers working less than  hectares  acres of land
in this type of agriculture a patch of forest land is cleared by a combination of felling chopping down and burning and crops are grown
after  years the fertility of the soil begins to decline the land is abandoned and the farmer moves to clear a fresh piece of land elsewhere in the forest as the process continues
while the land is left fallow the forest regrows in the cleared area and soil fertility and biomass is restored
after a decade or more the farmer may return to the first piece of land
this form of agriculture is sustainable at low population densities but higher population loads require more frequent clearing which prevents soil fertility from recovering opens up more of the forest canopy and encourages scrub at the expense of large trees eventually resulting in deforestation and land erosion
shifting cultivation is called dredd in india ladang in indonesia milpa in central america and mexico and jhumming in north east india
while this slashandburn technique may describe the method for opening new land commonly the farmers in question have in existence at the same time smaller fields sometimes merely gardens near the homestead there they practice intensive nonshifting techniques until shortage of fields where they can employ slash and burn to clear land and by the burning provide fertilizer ash
such gardens near the homestead often regularly receive household refuse and the manure of any household chickens or goats are initially thrown into compost piles just to get them out of the way
however such farmers often recognize the value of such compost and apply it regularly to their smaller fields
they also may irrigate part of such fields if they are near a source of water
in some areas of tropical africa at least such smaller fields may be ones in which crops are grown on raised beds
thus farmers practicing slash and burn agriculture are often much more sophisticated agriculturalists than the term slash and burn subsistence farmers suggests
in this type of farming people migrate along with their animals from one place to another in search of fodder for their animals
generally they rear cattle sheep goats camels andor yaks for milk skin meat and wool
this way of life is common in parts of central and western asia india east and southwest africa and northern eurasia
examples are the nomadic bhotiyas and gujjars of the himalayas
they carry their belongings such as tents etc on the backs of donkeys horses and camels
in mountainous regions like tibet and the andes yak and llama are reared
reindeer are the livestock in arctic and subarctic areas
sheep goats and camels are common animals and cattle and horses are also important
in intensive subsistence agriculture the farmer cultivates a small plot of land using simple tools and more labour
climate with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permits growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot
farmers use their small land holdings to produce enough for their local consumption while remaining produce is used for exchange against other goods
it results in much more food being produced per acre compared to other subsistence patterns
in the most intensive situation farmers may even create terraces along steep hillsides to cultivate rice paddies
such fields are found in densely populated parts of asia such as in the philippines
they may also intensify by using manure artificial irrigation and animal waste as fertilizer
intensive subsistence farming is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south southwest and southeast asia
subsistence agriculture can be used as a poverty alleviation strategy specifically as a safety net for foodprice shocks and for food security
poor countries are limited in fiscal and institutional resources that would allow them to contain rises in domestic prices as well as to manage social assistance programs which is often because they are using policy tools that are intended for middle and highincome countries
lowincome countries tend to have populations in which  of poor are in rural areas and more than  of rural households have access to land yet a majority of these rural poor have insufficient access to food
subsistence agriculture can be used in lowincome countries as a part of policy responses to a food crisis in the short and medium term and provide a safety net for the poor in these countries
sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways meeting societys present food and textile needs without compromising the ability for current or future generations to meet their needs
it can be based on an understanding of ecosystem services
there are many methods to increase the sustainability of agriculture
when developing agriculture within sustainable food systems it is important to develop flexible business process and farming practices
agriculture has an enormous environmental footprint playing a significant role in causing climate change water scarcity land degradation deforestation and other processes it is simultaneously causing environmental changes and being impacted by these changes
developing sustainable food systems contributes to the sustainability of the human population
for example one of the best ways to mitigate climate change is to create sustainable food systems based on sustainable agriculture
sustainable agriculture provides a potential solution to enable agricultural systems to feed a growing population within the changing environmental conditions
in  franklin h king in his book farmers of forty centuries discussed the advantages of sustainable agriculture and warned that such practices would be vital to farming in the future
the phrase sustainable agriculture was reportedly coined by the australian agronomist gordon mcclymont
the term became popular in the late s
there was an international symposium on sustainability in horticulture by the international society of horticultural science at the international horticultural congress in toronto in 
at the following conference at seoul in  the principles were discussed further
in the us national agricultural research extension and teaching policy act of  the term sustainable agriculture is defined as an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a sitespecific application that will over the long term
the british scholar jules pretty has stated several key principles associated with sustainability in agriculture
it considers longterm as well as shortterm economics because sustainability is readily defined as forever that is agricultural environments that are designed to promote endless regeneration
it balances the need for resource conservation with the needs of farmers pursuing their livelihood
it is considered to be reconciliation ecology accommodating biodiversity within human landscapes
there is a debate on the definition of sustainability regarding agriculture
the definition could be characterized by two different approaches an ecocentric approach and a technocentric approach
the ecocentric approach emphasizes no or lowgrowth levels of human development and focuses on organic and biodynamic farming techniques with the goal of changing consumption patterns and resource allocation and usage
the technocentric approach argues that sustainability can be attained through a variety of strategies from the view that stateled modification of the industrial system like conservationoriented farming systems should be implemented to the argument that biotechnology is the best way to meet the increasing demand for food
one can look at the topic of sustainable agriculture through two different lenses multifunctional agriculture and ecosystem services
both of approaches are similar but look at the function of agriculture differently
those that employ the multifunctional agriculture philosophy focus on farmcentered approaches and define function as being the outputs of agricultural activity
the central argument of multifunctionality is that agriculture is a multifunctional enterprise with other functions aside from the production of food and fiber
these functions include renewable resource management landscape conservation and biodiversity
the ecosystem servicecentered approach posits that individuals and society as a whole receive benefits from ecosystems which are called ecosystem services
in sustainable agriculture the services that ecosystems provide include pollination soil formation and nutrient cycling all of which are necessary functions for the production of food
it is also claimed sustainable agriculture is best considered as an ecosystem approach to agriculture called agroecology
most agricultural professionals agree that there is a moral obligation to pursue the goal of sustainability
the major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population
practices that can cause longterm damage to soil include excessive tilling of the soil leading to erosion and irrigation without adequate drainage leading to salinization
the most important factors for a farming site are climate soil nutrients and water resources
of the four water and soil conservation are the most amenable to human intervention
when farmers grow and harvest crops they remove some nutrients from the soil
without replenishment the land suffers from nutrient depletion and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced yields
sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of nonrenewable resources such as natural gas or mineral ores
a farm that can produce perpetually yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture
an example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is the application of fertilizer or manure which can improve the productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters eutrophication
the other extreme can also be undesirable as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to rainforest destruction
in asia the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about  acres which include land for animal fodder cereal production as a cash crop and other food crops
in some cases a small unit of aquaculture is included aari
possible sources of nitrates that would in principle be available indefinitely include
the last option was proposed in the s but is only gradually becoming feasible
sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited
other options include longterm crop rotations returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands returning lost nutrients such as the flooding of the nile the longterm use of biochar and use of crop and livestock landraces that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests drought or lack of nutrients
crops that require high levels of soil nutrients can be cultivated in a more sustainable manner with appropriate fertilizer management practices
phosphate is a primary component in fertilizer
it is the second most important nutrient for plants after nitrogen and is often a limiting factor
it is important for sustainable agriculture as it can improve soil fertility and crop yields
phosphorus is involved in all major metabolic processes including photosynthesis energy transfer signal transduction macromolecular biosynthesis and respiration
it is needed for root ramification and strength and seed formation and can increase disease resistance
phosphorus is found in the soil in both inorganic and organic forms and makes up approximately  of soil biomass
phosphorus fertilizers are the main input of inorganic phosphorus in agricultural soils and approximately   of phosphorus in cultivated soils is inorganic
longterm use of phosphatecontaining chemical fertilizers causes eutrophication and deplete soil microbial life so people have looked to other sources
phosphorus fertilizers are manufactured from rock phosphate
however rock phosphate is a nonrenewable resource and it is being depleted by mining for agricultural use peak phosphorus will occur within the next few hundred years or perhaps earlier
land degradation is becoming a severe global problem
according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change about a quarter of the earths icefree land area is subject to humaninduced degradation medium confidence
soil erosion from agricultural fields is estimated to be currently  to  times no tillage to more than  times conventional tillage higher than the soil formation rate medium confidence
over a billion tonnes of southern africas soil are being lost to erosion annually which if continued will result in halving of crop yields within thirty to fifty years
improper soil management is threatening the ability to grow sufficient food
intensive agriculture reduces the carbon level in soil impairing soil structure crop growth and ecosystem functioning and accelerating climate change
soil management techniques include notill farming keyline design and windbreaks to reduce wind erosion reincorporation of organic matter into the soil reducing soil salinization and preventing water runoff
as the global population increases and demand for food increases there is pressure on land as a resource
in landuse planning and management considering the impacts of landuse changes on factors such as soil erosion can support longterm agricultural sustainability as shown by a study of wadi ziqlab a dry area in the middle east where farmers graze livestock and grow olives vegetables and grains
looking back over the th century shows that for people in poverty following environmentally sound land practices has not always been a viable option due to many complex and challenging life circumstances
currently increased land degradation in developing countries may be connected with rural poverty among smallholder farmers when forced into unsustainable agricultural practices out of necessity
converting big parts of the land surface to agriculture have severe environmental and health consequences
for example it leads to rise in zoonotic disease like the coronavirus disease  by degrading natural buffers between humans and animals reducing biodiversity and creating big groups of genetically similar animals
land is a finite resource on earth
although expansion of agricultural land can decrease biodiversity and contribute to deforestation the picture is complex for instance a study examining the introduction of sheep by norse settlers vikings to the faroe islands of the north atlantic concluded that over time the fine partitioning of land plots contributed more to soil erosion and degradation than grazing itself
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations estimates that in coming decades cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development along with reclamation of wetlands and conversion of forest to cultivation resulting in the loss of biodiversity and increased soil erosion
in modern agriculture energy is used in onfarm mechanisation food processing storage and transportation processes
it has therefore been found that energy prices are closely linked to food prices
oil is also used as an input in agricultural chemicals
the international energy agency projects higher prices of nonrenewable energy resources as a result of fossil fuel resources being depleted
it may therefore decrease global food security unless action is taken to decouple fossil fuel energy from food production with a move towards energysmart agricultural systems including renewable energy
the use of solar powered irrigation in pakistan is said to be a closed system for agricultural water irrigation
also in a hot climate and ocean acidification scenario with fisheries substantially depleted it will be increasingly necessary to cool chicken houses and other farm buildings
using solar and wind power for this required cooling and sanitation offers a more sustainable path to meat egg dairy and other protein and mineralrich food production
the environmental cost of transportation could be avoided if people use local products
in some areas sufficient rainfall is available for crop growth but many other areas require irrigation
for irrigation systems to be sustainable they require proper management to avoid salinization and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable
otherwise the water source effectively becomes a nonrenewable resource
improvements in water well drilling technology and submersible pumps combined with the development of drip irrigation and lowpressure pivots have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable
however this progress has come at a price
in many areas such as the ogallala aquifer the water is being used faster than it can be replenished
according to the uc davis agricultural sustainability institute several steps must be taken to develop droughtresistant farming systems even in normal years with average rainfall
these measures include both policy and management actions
indicators for sustainable water resource development include the average annual flow of rivers from rainfall flows from outside a country the percentage of water coming from outside a country and gross water withdrawal
costs such as environmental problems not covered in traditional accounting systems which take into account only the direct costs of production incurred by the farmer are known as externalities
netting studied sustainability and intensive agriculture in smallholder systems through history
there are several studies incorporating externalities such as ecosystem services biodiversity land degradation and sustainable land management in economic analysis
these include the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity study and the economics of land degradation initiative which seek to establish an economic costbenefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management and sustainable agriculture
triple bottom line frameworks include social and environmental alongside a financial bottom line
a sustainable future can be feasible if growth in material consumption and population is slowed down and if there is a drastic increase in the efficiency of material and energy use
to make that transition long and shortterm goals will need to be balanced enhancing equity and quality of life
other practices include growing a diverse number of perennial crops in a single field each of which would grow in separate season so as not to compete with each other for natural resources
this system would result in increased resistance to diseases and decreased effects of erosion and loss of nutrients in soil
nitrogen fixation from legumes for example used in conjunction with plants that rely on nitrate from soil for growth helps to allow the land to be reused annually
legumes will grow for a season and replenish the soil with ammonium and nitrate and the next season other plants can be seeded and grown in the field in preparation for harvest
sustainable methods of weed management may help reduce the development of herbicideresistant weeds
crop rotation may also replenish nitrogen if legumes are used in the rotations and may also use resources more efficiently
there are also many ways to practice sustainable animal husbandry
some of the tools to grazing management include fencing off the grazing area into smaller areas called paddocks lowering stock density and moving the stock between paddocks frequently
an increased production is a goal of intensification
sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes
the desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost
sustainable intensification has become a priority for the united nations
sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes
by the year  it was predicted in  nations a combined total of  million farms used sustainable intensification
the amount of agricultural land covered by this is  million ha of land
that amount of land is equal to  of farms worldwide
in light of concerns about food security human population growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high crop yields while maintaining soil health and ecosystem services
the capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of nonrenewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate
recent work in irrigated rice production system of east asia has suggested that in relation to pest management at least promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by  whilst delivering a  yield advantage compared with standard practice
vertical farming is a concept with the potential advantages of yearround production isolation from pests and diseases controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs
water efficiency can be improved by reducing the need for irrigation and using alternative methods
such methods includes researching on drought resistant crops monitoring plant transpiration and reducing soil evaporation
drought resistant crops have been researched extensively as a means to overcome the issue of water shortage
they are modified genetically so they can adapt in an environment with little water
this is beneficial as it reduces the need for irrigation and helps conserve water
although they have been extensively researched significant results have not been achieved as most of the successful species will have no overall impact on water conservation
however some grains like rice for example have been successfully genetically modified to be drought resistant
soil amendments include using compost from recycling centers
using compost from yard and kitchen waste uses available resources in the area
abstinence from soil tillage before planting and leaving the plant residue after harvesting reduces soil water evaporation it also serves to prevent soil erosion
crop residues left covering the surface of the soil may result in reduced evaporation of water a lower surface soil temperature and reduction of wind effects
a way to make rock phosphate more effective is to add microbial inoculates such as phosphatesolubilizing microorganisms known as psms to the soil
these solubilize phosphorus already in the soil and use processes like organic acid production and ion exchange reactions to make that phosphorus available for plants
experimentally these psms have been shown to increase crop growth in terms of shoot height dry biomass and grain yield
phosphorus uptake is even more efficient with the presence of mycorrhizae in the soil
mycorrhiza is a type of mutualistic symbiotic association between plants and fungi which are wellequipped to absorb nutrients including phosphorus in soil
these fungi can increase nutrient uptake in soil where phosphorus has been fixed by aluminum calcium and iron
mycorrhizae can also release organic acids that solubilize otherwise unavailable phosphorus
soil steaming can be used as an alternative to chemicals for soil sterilization
different methods are available to induce steam into the soil to kill pests and increase soil health
solarizing is based on the same principle used to increase the temperature of the soil to kill pathogens and pests
certain plants can be cropped for use as biofumigants natural fumigants releasing pest suppressing compounds when crushed ploughed into the soil and covered in plastic for four weeks
plants in the brassicaceae family release large amounts of toxic compounds such as methyl isothiocyanates
sustainability may also involve crop rotation
crop rotation and cover crops prevent soil erosion by protecting topsoil from wind and water
effective crop rotation can reduce pest pressure on crops and replenish soil nutrients
this reduces the need for fertilizers and pesticides
increasing the diversity of crops by introducing new genetic resources can increase yields
perennial crops reduce the need for tillage and thus help mitigate soil erosion and may sometimes tolerate drought better increase water quality and help increase soil organic matter
there are research programs attempting to develop perennial substitutes for existing annual crops such as replacing wheat with the wild grass thinopyrum intermedium or possible experimental hybrids of it and wheat
often thought of as inherently destructive slashandburn or slashandchar shifting cultivation have been practised in the amazon for thousands of years
some traditional systems combine polyculture with sustainability
in southeast asia ricefish systems on rice paddies have raised freshwater fish as well as rice producing an additional product and reducing eutrophication of neighbouring rivers
a variant in indonesia combines rice fish ducks and water fern the ducks eat the weeds that would otherwise limit rice growth saving labour and herbicides while the duck and fish manure substitute for fertilizer
raised field agriculture has been recently revived in certain areas of the world such as the altiplano region in bolivia and peru
this has resurged in the form of traditional waru waru raised fields which create nutrientrich soil in regions where such soil is scarce
this method is extremely productive and has recently been utilized by indigenous groups in the area and the nearby amazon basin to make use of lands that have been historically hard to cultivate
in ohio some farmers that could not buy land good for agriculture restored soil considered as unsuitable for any agricultural activity with traditional methods
the use of available city space eg rooftop gardens community gardens garden sharing and other forms of urban agriculture may be able to contribute to sustainability
there is limited evidence polyculture may contribute to sustainable agriculture
a metaanalysis of a number of polycrop studies found that predator insect biodiversity was higher at comparable yields than conventional in certain twocrop systems with a single cash crop combined with a cover crop
one approach to sustainability is to develop polyculture systems using perennial crop varieties
such varieties are being developed for rice wheat sorghum barley and sunflowers
if these can be combined in polyculture with a leguminous cover crop such as alfalfa fixation of nitrogen will be added to the system reducing the need for fertilizer and pesticides
organic agriculture can be defined as
an integrated farming system that strives for sustainability the enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity whilst with rare exceptions prohibiting synthetic pesticides antibiotics synthetic fertilizers genetically modified organisms and growth hormones
some claim organic agriculture may produce the most sustainable products available for consumers in the us where no other alternatives exist although the focus of the organics industry is not sustainability
in the sales of organic products in usa reach  billion according to a big survey two thirds of americans consume organic products at least occasionally
regenerative agriculture is a conservation and rehabilitation approach to food and farming systems
it focuses on topsoil regeneration increasing biodiversity improving the water cycle enhancing ecosystem services supporting biosequestration increasing resilience to climate change and strengthening the health and vitality of farm soil
practices include recycling as much farm waste as possible and adding composted material from sources outside the farm
permaculture is an approach to land management and philosophy that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems
it includes a set of design principles derived using whole systems thinking
it uses these principles in fields such as regenerative agriculture rewilding and community resilience
permaculture was originally a portmanteau of permanent agriculture but was later adjusted to permanent culture to incorporate necessary social aspects as inspired by masanobu fukuokas natural farming
the term was coined by bill mollison and david holmgren in  who formulated the concept in opposition to western industrialized methods and in congruence with indigenous or traditional knowledge
in the united nations reported on organic agriculture and food security in africa stating that using sustainable agriculture could be a tool in reaching global food security without expanding land usage and reducing environmental impacts
there has been evidence provided by developing nations from the early s stating that when people in their communities are not factored into the agricultural process that serious harm is done
the social scientist charles kellogg has stated that in a final effort exploited people pass their suffering to the land
sustainable agriculture mean the ability to permanently and continuously feed its constituent populations
there are a lot of opportunities that can increase farmers profits improve communities and continue sustainable practices
for example in uganda genetically modified organisms were originally illegal however with the stress of banana crisis in uganda where banana bacterial wilt had the potential to wipe out  of yield they decided to explore gmos as a possible solution
the government issued the national biotechnology and biosafety bill which will allow scientists that are part of the national banana research program to start experimenting with genetically modified organisms
this effort has the potential to help local communities because a significant portion live off the food they grow themselves and it will be profitable because the yield of their main produce will remain stable
not all regions are suitable for agriculture
the technological advancement of the past few decades has allowed agriculture to develop in some of these regions
for example nepal has built greenhouses to deal with its high altitude and mountainous regions
greenhouses allow for greater crop production and also use less water since they are closed systems
desalination techniques can turn salt water into fresh water which allows greater access to water for areas with a limited supply
this allows the irrigation of crops without decreasing natural fresh water sources
while desalination can be a tool to provide water to areas that need it to sustain agriculture it requires money and resources
regions of china have been considering large scale desalination in order to increase access to water but the current cost of the desalination process makes it impractical
women working in sustainable agriculture come from numerous backgrounds from academic and labour
in the past  years  in the united states the number of women farm operators has tripled
today women operate  percent of farms compared to five percent in 
much of the growth is due to women farming outside the male dominated field of conventional agriculture
the practice of growing food in the backyard of houses schools etc by families or by communities became widespread in the us at the time of world war one the great recession and world war two so that in one point of time  of the vegetables of the usa was produced in this way
the practice became more popular again in the time of the covid pandemic
this method permits to grow food in a relatively sustainable way and at the same time make easier for poor people to obtain food
sustainable agriculture is a topic in international policy concerning its potential to reduce environmental risks
in the commission on sustainable agriculture and climate change as part of its recommendations for policymakers on achieving food security in the face of climate change urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy
the commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience
it also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade including in national research and development budgets land rehabilitation economic incentives and infrastructure improvement
in may  the european union published a program named from farm to fork for making its agriculture more sustainable
in the official page of the program from farm to fork is cited frans timmermans the executive vicepresident of the european commission saying that
the coronavirus crisis has shown how vulnerable we all are and how important it is to restore the balance between human activity and nature
at the heart of the green deal the biodiversity and farm to fork strategies point to a new and better balance of nature food systems and biodiversity to protect our peoples health and wellbeing and at the same time to increase the eus competitiveness and resilience
these strategies are a crucial part of the great transition we are embarking upon
the program includes the next targets
in the chinese government adopted a plan to reduce chinas meat consumption by  for achieving more sustainable and healthy food system
in the united states the federal natural resources conservation service provides technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation along with production agriculture
with programs like sare and chinauk sustainable agriculture innovation network to help promote research on sustainable agriculture practices and a framework for agriculture and climate change respectively
in mexico banned the domestic growing of gmo corn and announced a future ban on import by 
according to the announcement the use of glyphosate will also be banned by the same year
among  farmers interviewed in tasmania most accepted the notion climate change was happening but just a small segment believed that it was humanrelated
few farmers thought that the issue of climate change was significant enough to diminish what was causing it
some of the farmers were worried about how a suggested carbon dioxide reduction plan would affect the agricultural sector and were suspicious of numerous government related activities seeing them as methods in which the government could punish producers
the author james howard kunstler claims almost all modern technology is bad and that there can not be sustainability unless agriculture is done in ancient traditional ways
efforts toward more sustainable agriculture are supported in the sustainability community however these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end
some foresee a true sustainable steady state economy that may be very different from todays greatly reduced energy usage minimal ecological footprint fewer consumer packaged goods local purchasing with short food supply chains little processed foods more home and community gardens etc
according to michael carolan a major barrier to the adoption of sustainable agriculture is its appearance of a lack of benefits
many benefits are not visible or immediately evident and affecting changes such as lower rates of soil and nutrient loss improved soil structure and higher levels of beneficial microorganisms takes time
in conventional agriculture the benefits are easily visible with no weeds pests etcand the costs to soil and ecosystems around it are hidden and externalised

in cooking al dente italian pronunciation al dɛnte describes pasta or rice that is cooked to be firm to the bite
the etymology is italian to the toothin contemporary italian cooking the term identifies the ideal consistency for pasta and involves a brief cooking time
molto al dente is the culinary term for slightly undercooked pasta
undercooking pasta is used in the first round of cooking when a pasta dish is going to be cooked twice
according to the american diabetes association pasta that is cooked al dente has a lower glycemic index than pasta that is cooked soft
when cooking commercial pasta the al dente phase occurs right after the white of the pasta center disappears
al forno al forno literally to the oven meaning baked is food that has been baked in an oven
italian dishes commonly prepared in this way include pizza breads and pasta dishes notably lasagna
pasta is sometimes boiled before it is baked in al forno dishes
this double cooking means that it is served soft not with the firm al dente consistency that some italians prefer in pasta dishes
southern italy has a tradition of woodburning ovens and openflame grills
a woodfired oven and al forno dishes are a feature of many italian restaurants
brick and clay ovens are a key feature of cuisines of the mediterranean and middle east with wood being the main fuel for many parts of europe for many centuries
a typical oven found in italian restaurants is brick lined with an arched oven door and a wooden board with a very long handle is used to place the food to be cooked in the centre of the oven
baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat typically in an oven
but can also be done in hot ashes or on hot stones
the most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked
 heat is gradually transferred from the surface of cakes cookies and breads to their center
as heat travels through it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center
 baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously or one after the other
baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit
because of historical social and familial roles baking has traditionally been performed at home by women for daytoday meals and by men in bakeries and restaurants for local consumption
when production was industrialized baking was automated by machines in large factories
the art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for nutrition as baked goods especially breads are a common and important food both from an economic and cultural point of view
a person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a baker
on a related note a pastry chef is someone who is trained in the art of making pastries desserts bread and other baked goods
all types of food can be baked but some require special care and protection from direct heat
various techniques have been developed to provide this protection
in addition to bread baking is used to prepare cakes pastries pies tarts quiches cookies scones crackers pretzels and more
these popular items are known collectively as baked goods and are often sold at a bakery which is a store that carries only baked goods or at markets grocery stores farmers markets or through other venues
meat including cured meats such as ham can also be baked but baking is usually reserved for meatloaf smaller cuts of whole meats or whole meats that contain stuffing or coating such as bread crumbs or buttermilk batter
some foods are surrounded with moisture during baking by placing a small amount of liquid such as water or broth in the bottom of a closed pan and letting it steam up around the food
roasting is a term synonymous with baking but traditionally denotes the cooking of whole animals or major cuts through exposure to dry heat for instance one bakes chicken parts but roasts the whole bird
one can bake pork or lamb chops but roasts the whole loin or leg
there are many exceptions to this rule of the two terms
baking and roasting otherwise involve the same range of cooking times and temperatures
another form of baking is the method known as en croûte french for in a pastry crust which protects the food from direct heat and seals the natural juices inside
meat poultry game fish or vegetables can be prepared by baking en croûte
wellknown examples include beef wellington where the beef is encased in pastry before baking pâté en croûte where the terrine is encased in pastry before baking and the vietnamese variant a meatfilled pastry called pâté chaud
the en croûte method also allows meat to be baked by burying it in the embers of a fire a favorite method of cooking venison
salt can also be used to make a protective crust that is not eaten
another method of protecting food from the heat while it is baking is to cook it en papillote french for in parchment
in this method the food is covered by baking paper or aluminium foil to protect it while it is being baked
the cooked parcel of food is sometimes served unopened allowing diners to discover the contents for themselves which adds an element of surprise
eggs can also be used in baking to produce savoury or sweet dishes
in combination with dairy products especially cheese they are often prepared as a dessert
for example although a baked custard can be made using starch in the form of flour cornflour arrowroot or potato flour the flavor of the dish is much more delicate if eggs are used as the thickening agent
baked custards such as crème caramel are among the items that need protection from an ovens direct heat and the bainmarie method serves this purpose
the cooking container is half submerged in water in another larger one so that the heat in the oven is more gently applied during the baking process
baking a successful soufflé requires that the baking process be carefully controlled
the oven temperature must be absolutely even and the oven space not shared with another dish
these factors along with the theatrical effect of an airfilled dessert have given this baked food a reputation for being a culinary achievement
similarly a good baking technique and a good oven are also needed to create a baked alaska because of the difficulty of baking hot meringue and cold ice cream at the same time
baking can also be used to prepare other foods such as pizzas baked potatoes baked apples baked beans some casseroles and pasta dishes such as lasagne
the first evidence of baking occurred when humans took wild grass grains soaked them in water and mixed everything together mashing it into a kind of brothlike paste
the paste was cooked by pouring it onto a flat hot rock resulting in a breadlike substance
later when humans mastered fire the paste was roasted on hot embers which made breadmaking easier as it could now be made any time fire was created
the worlds oldest oven was discovered in croatia in  dating back  years ago
the ancient egyptians baked bread using yeast which they had previously been using to brew beer
bread baking began in ancient greece around  bc leading to the invention of enclosed ovens
ovens and worktables have been discovered in archaeological digs from turkey hacilar to palestine jericho tell essultan and date back to  bc
baking flourished during the roman empire
beginning around  bc the pastry cook became an occupation for romans known as the pastillarium and became a respected profession because pastries were considered decadent and romans loved festivity and celebration
thus pastries were often cooked especially for large banquets and any pastry cook who could invent new types of tasty treats was highly prized
around  ad there were more than three hundred pastry chefs in rome and cato wrote about how they created all sorts of diverse foods and flourished professionally and socially because of their creations
cato speaks of an enormous number of breads including libum sacrificial cakes made with flour placenta groats and cress spira modern day flour pretzels scibilata tortes savaillum sweet cake and globus apherica fritters
a great selection of these with many different variations different ingredients and varied patterns were often found at banquets and dining halls
the romans baked bread in an oven with its own chimney and had mills to grind grain into flour
a bakers guild was established in  bc
in rome
eventually the roman art of baking became known throughout europe and eventually spread to eastern parts of asia
by the th century in london commercial trading including baking had many regulations attached
in the case of food they were designed to create a system so there was little possibility of false measures adulterated food or shoddy manufactures
there were by that time twenty regulations applying to bakers alone including that every baker had to have the impression of his seal upon bread
beginning in the th century alternative leavening agents became more common such as baking soda
bakers often baked goods at home and then sold them in the streets
this scene was so common that rembrandt among others painted a pastry chef selling pancakes in the streets of germany with children clamoring for a sample
in london pastry chefs sold their goods from handcarts
this developed into a delivery system of baked goods to households and greatly increased demand as a result
in paris the first openair café of baked goods was developed and baking became an established art throughout the entire world
citation needed
every family used to prepare the bread for its own consumption the trade of baking not having yet taken shape
mrs beeton baking eventually developed into a commercial industry using automated machinery which enabled more goods to be produced for widespread distribution
in the united states the baking industry was built on marketing methods used during feudal times and production techniques developed by the romans
some makers of snacks such as potato chips or crisps have produced baked versions of their snack products as an alternative to the usual cooking method of deep frying in an attempt to reduce their calorie or fat content
baking has opened up doors to businesses such as cake shops and factories where the baking process is done with larger amounts in large open furnaces

the aroma and texture of baked goods as they come out of the oven are strongly appealing but is a quality that is quickly lost
since the flavour and appeal largely depend on freshness commercial producers have to compensate by using food additives as well as imaginative labeling
as more and more baked goods are purchased from commercial suppliers producers try to capture that original appeal by adding the label homebaked
such attempts seek to make an emotional link to the remembered freshness of baked goods as well as to attach positive associations the purchaser has with the idea of home to the bought product
freshness is such an important quality that restaurants although they are commercial and not domestic preparers of food bake their own products
for example scones at the ritz london hotel are not baked until early afternoon on the day they are to be served to make sure they are as fresh as possible
baking needs an enclosed space for heating typically in an oven
the fuel can be supplied by wood coal gas or electricity
adding and removing items from an oven may be done by hand with an oven mitt or by a peel a long handled tool specifically used for that purpose
many commercial ovens are equipped with two heating elements one for baking using convection and thermal conduction to heat the food and one for broiling or grilling heating mainly by radiation
another piece of equipment still used for baking is the dutch oven
also called a bake kettle bastable bread oven fire pan bake oven kail pot tin kitchen roasting kitchen doufeu french gentle fire or feu de compagne french country oven it originally replaced the cooking jack as the latest fireside cooking technology combining the convenience of potoven and hangover oven
asian cultures have adopted steam baskets to produce the effect of baking while reducing the amount of fat needed
eleven events occur concurrently during baking some of which such as starch gelatinization would not occur at room temperature
the dry heat of baking changes the form of starches in the food and causes its outer surfaces to brown giving it an attractive appearance and taste
the browning is caused by caramelization of sugars and the maillard reaction
maillard browning occurs when sugars break down in the presence of proteins
because foods contain many different types of sugars and proteins maillard browning contributes to the flavour of a wide range of foods including nuts roast beef and baked bread
the moisture is never entirely sealed in over time an item being baked will become dry
this is often an advantage especially in situations where drying is the desired outcome like drying herbs or roasting certain types of vegetables
the baking process does not require any fat to be used to cook in an oven
when baking consideration must be given to the amount of fat that is contained in the food item
higher levels of fat such as margarine butter lard or vegetable shortening will cause an item to spread out during the baking process
with the passage of time breads harden and become stale
this is not primarily due to moisture being lost from the baked products but more a reorganization of the way in which the water and starch are associated over time
this process is similar to recrystallization and is promoted by storage at cool temperatures such as in a domestic refrigerator or freezer
baking especially of bread holds special significance for many cultures
it is such a fundamental part of everyday food consumption that the childrens nursery rhyme patacake patacake bakers man takes baking as its subject
baked goods are normally served at all kinds of parties and special attention is given to their quality at formal events
they are also one of the main components of a tea party including at nursery teas and high teas a tradition which started in victorian britain reportedly when anna russell duchess of bedford grew tired of the sinking feeling which afflicted her every afternoon round  oclock
in  she plucked up courage and asked for a tray of tea bread and butter and cake to be brought to her room
once she had formed the habit she found she could not break it so spread it among her friends instead
as the century progressed afternoon tea became increasingly elaborate

charcuterie listen sharkootəree also us listen ⁠ee french listen from chair meat and cuit cooked is a french term for a branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat products such as bacon ham sausage terrines galantines ballotines pâtés and confit primarily from porkcharcuterie is part of the garde manger chefs repertoire
originally intended as a way to preserve meat before the advent of refrigeration they are prepared today for their flavors derived from the preservation processes
the french word for a person who practices charcuterie is charcutier generally translated as pork butcher
this has led to the mistaken belief that charcuterie can only involve pork
the food lovers companion however says it refers to the products particularly but not limited to pork specialties such as pâtés rillettes galantines crépinettes etc which are made and sold in a delicatessenstyle shop also called a charcuterie
the  edition of larousse gastronomique defines it as the art of preparing various meats in particular pork in order to present them in the most diverse ways
in the first century ad strabo recorded the import of salted meat from gaul and the romans may have been the first to regulate the trade of charcuterie as they wrote laws regulating the proper production of pork joints but the french have also had some influence
in thcentury france local guilds regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city
the guilds that produced charcuterie were those of the charcutiers
the members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried meats which varied sometimes distinctively from region to region
the only raw meat the charcutiers were allowed to sell was unrendered lard
the charcutier prepared numerous items including pâtés rillettes sausages bacon trotters and head cheese brawn
these preservation methods ensured the meats would have longer shelf lives
charcuterie became symbolic then to lower status peasantry
forcemeat is a mixture of ground lean meat emulsified with fat
the emulsification can be accomplished by grinding sieving or puréeing the ingredients
the emulsification may either be smooth or coarse in texture depending on the desired consistency of the final product
forcemeats are used in the production of numerous items found in charcuterie
meats commonly used in the production of forcemeats include pork fish pike trout or salmon seafood game meats venison boar or rabbit poultry game birds veal and pork livers
pork fatback is often used for the fat portion of forcemeat as it has a somewhat neutral flavorin us usage there are four basic styles of forcemeat
straight forcemeats are produced by progressively grinding equal parts pork and pork fat with a third dominant meat which can be pork or another meat
the proteins are cubed and then seasoned cured rested ground and then placed into desired vessel
countrystyle forcemeats are a combination of pork pork fat often with the addition of pork liver and garnish ingredients
the finished product has a coarse texture
the third style is gratin which has a portion of the main protein browned the french term gratin connotes a grated product that is browned
the final style is mousseline which are very light in texture using lean cuts of meat usually from veal poultry fish or shellfish
the resulting texture comes from the addition of eggs and cream to this forcemeat
the word sausage is derived through french from the latin sal salt as the sausagemaking technique involves placing ground or chopped meat along with salt into a tube
the tubes can vary but the more common animalderived tubes include sheep hog or cattle intestinal linings
additionally animal stomachs and bladders as well as edible artificial casings produced from collagen and inedible plant cellulose or paper are also used
inedible casings are primarily used to shape store and age the sausage
the two main variants of sausage are fresh and cooked
fresh sausages involve the production of raw meat placed into casings to be cooked at a later time whereas cooked sausages are heated during production and are ready to eat at the end of production
emulsified sausages are cooked sausages with a very fine texture using the combination of pork beef or poultry with fat salt cure flavorings and water
these ingredients are emulsified at high speed in a food processor or blender
during this process the salt dissolves the muscle proteins which helps to suspend the fat molecules
temperature is an important part of the process if the temperature rises above   for pork or   for beef the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process
pâté and terrines are often cooked in a pastry crust or an earthenware container
both the earthenware container and the dish itself are called a terrine
pâté and terrine are very similar the term pâté often suggests a finertextured forcemeat using liver whereas terrines are more often made of a coarser forcemeat
the meat is chopped or ground along with heavy seasoning which may include fat and aromatics
the seasoning is important as they will generally be served cold which mutes the flavorsthe mixture is placed into a lined mold covered and cooked in a water bath to control the temperature which will keep the forcemeat from separating as the water bath slows the heating process of the terrine
pâté and terrine are generally cooked to   while terrine made of foie gras are generally cooked to an internal temperature of  
after the proper temperature is reached the terrine is removed from the oven and placed into a cooling unit topped with a weight to compact the contents of the terrine
it is then allowed to rest for several days to allow the flavors to blend
galantine is a chilled poultry product created after the french revolution by the chef to the marquis de brancas
the term galant connotes urbane sophistication
other origins are suggested the older french word for chicken géline or galine or the word gelatin
sources suggest the spelling of gelatin transformed into the words galentyne galyntyne galandyne and galendine
the galantine is prepared by skinning and boning a chicken or other poultry
the skin is laid flat with the pounded breast laid on top
a forcemeat is then placed on top of the pounded breast
the galantine is then rolled with the ends of the breast meeting one another
the galantine is then wrapped in cheesecloth and poached in poultry stock until the proper internal temperature is reachedroulade is similar to a galantine
the two major differences are instead of rolling the poultry evenly for the ends of the breasts to meet the bird is rolled into a pinwheel shape and the roulade is cooled by chilling it after it has been removed from the poaching liquid
salt serves four main purposes in the preservation of food in the charcuterie kitchen
the first is inducing osmosis this process involves the movement of water outside of the membranes of the cells which in turn reabsorb the salted water back into the cell
this process assists in the destruction of harmful pathogens
the second is dehydration which means the salt pulls excess water from the protein which aids in the shelf life of the protein as there is less moisture present for bacterial growth
fermentation is the third in which salt assists in halting the fermentation process which would otherwise completely break the meat down
finally salt assists in denaturing proteins which in essence means the structure of the proteins is effectively shifted similar to the effects of cookingbefore the discovery of nitrates and nitrites by german chemists around  curing was done with unrefined salt and saltpeter
as saltpeter gives inconsistent results in preventing bacterial growth nitrate and nitrite in the forms of sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate have increased in popularity for their consistent results
nitrates take a considerably longer period of time to break down in cured foods than nitrites
because of this nitrates are the preferred curing salts for lengthy curing and drying periods
nitrites are often used in foods that require a shorter curing time and are used for any item that will be fully cooked
eventually a portion of the nitrates will be converted into nitrites by bacterial action
nitrite has multiple purposes in the curing process
one purpose is flavor the nitrites giving a sharp piquant flavor to the meat
second the nitrites react with substances in the meat to produce nitric oxide
nitric oxide prevents iron from breaking down the fat in the meat thus halting rancidity
the binding also creates the characteristic reddish color found in most cured meat
finally the nitrite inhibits the growth of botulismcausing organisms that would ordinarily thrive in the oxygendeprived environment in the sausage casing
german scientists originally named botulism poisoning wurstvergiftung sausage poisoning
the term botulism derives its name from the latin term for sausageeating cured and processed meat products has been linked to a small increase in gastric cancer as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and colorectal cancer
the negative effects are presumed to be caused by nitrates and nitrites as well as nitrosamines which are formed by nitrites reacting with meat
these risks are generally regarded as minimal and regulations in the united states limit ingoing nitrites to  parts per million  less for bacon as a precautionary measure
two main types of curing salt mixture are used by the charcutier
the first is known by multiple names including tinted cure mix pink cure prague powder or instacure 
the mixture is  sodium chloride and  sodium nitrite
when used the recommended amount is a ratio of  oz for each  lb  kg for each  kg of meat or  of the total weight of the meat
this blend is colored bright pink to keep the charcutier from confusing the mixture with regular saltthe second curing salt blend is called prague powder ii or instacure 
also colored pink to differentiate it from table salt it contains  sodium nitrite  sodium nitrate and  table salt
this mixture is used for dry sausages that require a longer drying period which requires the presence of nitrate
sweeteners and other flavoring agents are necessary in the production of many cured products due to the harsh flavors of the salt
a number of sweeteners can be used in curing foods including dextrose sugar corn syrup honey and maple syrup
dextrose is seen often in cured meat as it not only mellows the harshness but it also increases the moisture content of the cured product while adding less sweetness to the cured meat
the sweeteners also assist in stabilizing the colors in meat and help the fermentation process by giving a nutrient to the bacterianumerous spices and herbs are used in the curing process to assist with the flavor of the final product
the sweet spices regularly used include cinnamon allspice nutmeg mace and cardamom
other flavoring agents may include dried and fresh chilies wine fruit juice or vinegar
fermented sausages are created by salting chopped or ground meat to remove moisture while allowing beneficial bacteria to break down sugars into flavorful molecules
bacteria including lactobacillus species and leuconostoc species break down these sugars to produce lactic acid which not only affects the flavor of the sausage but also lowers the ph from  to  preventing the growth of bacteria that could spoil the sausage
these effects are magnified during the drying process as the salt and acidity are concentrated as moisture is extracted

education is available from many culinary institutions offering diploma associate and bachelors degree programs in culinary arts
depending on the level of education this can take one to four years
an internship is often part of the curriculum
regardless of the education received most professional kitchens follow the apprenticeship system and most new cooks will start at a lowerlevel nd or st cook position and work their way up
like many skilled trades chefs usually go through a formal apprenticeship which includes many years of on the job training
culinary schools and restaurants offer these apprenticeships
to become an apprentice one must be at least  years old and have a high school diploma or ged
apprenticeships usually take  to  years to complete and combine classroom instruction with on the job training
the training period for a chef is generally four years as an apprentice
a newly qualified chef is advanced or more commonly a toquecommischef consisting of firstyear commis secondyear commis and so on
the rate of pay is usually in accordance with the chefs
like all other chefs except the executivechef trainees are placed in sections of the kitchen eg the starter appetizer or entrée sections under the guidance of a demichef de partie and are given relatively basic tasks
ideally over time a commis will spend a certain period in each section of the kitchen to learn the basics
unaided a commis may work on the vegetable station of a kitchenthe usual formal training period for a chef is two to four years in catering college
they often spend the summer in work placements
in some cases this is modified to dayrelease courses a chef will work fulltime in a kitchen as an apprentice and then would have allocated days off to attend catering college

chocolate is a preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is made in the form of a liquid paste or in a block which may also be used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods
the earliest signs of use are associated with olmec sites within what would become mexico s postcolonial territory suggesting consumption of chocolate beverages dating from the th century bc
the majority of mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages including the maya and aztecs
the english word chocolate comes via spanish from the classical nahuatl word xocolātlthe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor
after fermentation the beans are dried cleaned and roasted
the shell is removed to produce cacao nibs which are then ground to cocoa mass unadulterated chocolate in rough form
once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating it is called chocolate liquor
the liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components cocoa solids and cocoa butter
baking chocolate also called bitter chocolate contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions without any added sugar
powdered baking cocoa which contains more fiber than cocoa butter can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa
much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate a combination of cocoa solids cocoa butter or added vegetable oils and sugar
milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk
white chocolate contains cocoa butter sugar and milk but no cocoa solids
chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world and many food stuffs involving chocolate exist particularly desserts including cakes pudding mousse chocolate brownies and chocolate chip cookies
many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate
chocolate bars either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate are eaten as snacks
gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes such as eggs hearts coins are traditional on certain western holidays including christmas easter valentines day and hanukkah
chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate and in some alcoholic drinks such as creme de cacao
although cocoa originated in the americas west african countries particularly côte divoire and ghana are the leading producers of cocoa in the st century accounting for some  of the world cocoa supply
with some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in west africa child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in  international attempts to improve conditions for children were failing because of persistent poverty absence of schools increasing world cocoa demand more intensive farming of cocoa and continued exploitation of child labor
chocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history
for example one vessel found at an olmec archaeological site on the gulf coast of veracruz mexico dates chocolates preparation by preolmec peoples as early as  bc
on the pacific coast of chiapas mexico a mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cacao beverages dating even earlier to  bc
the residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cacao was not simply as a beverage but the white pulp around the cacao beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink
an early classicperiod  ad mayan tomb from the site in rio azul had vessels with the maya glyph for cacao on them with residue of a chocolate drink suggests the maya were drinking chocolate around  ad
documents in maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes in addition to everyday life
the maya grew cacao trees in their backyards and used the cacao seeds the trees produced to make a frothy bitter drinkby the th century the aztecs gained control of a large part of mesoamerica and adopted cacao into their culture
they associated chocolate with quetzalcoatl who according to one legend was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice
in contrast to the maya who liked their chocolate warm the aztecs drank it cold seasoning it with a broad variety of additives including the petals of the cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree chile pepper allspice vanilla and honey
the aztecs were unable to grow cacao themselves as their home in the mexican highlands was unsuitable for it so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire
those who lived in areas ruled by the aztecs were required to offer cacao seeds in payment of the tax they deemed tribute
cocoa beans were often used as currency
for example the aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost  cacao beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beansthe maya and aztecs associated cacao with human sacrifice and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood
the spanish royal chronicler gonzalo fernández de oviedo y valdés described a chocolate drink he had seen in nicaragua in  mixed with achiote because those people are fond of drinking human blood to make this beverage seem like blood they add a little achiote so that it then turns red
and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth and when it is red for having achiote it seems a horrific thing because it seems like blood itself
until the th century no european had ever heard of the popular drink from the central american peoples
christopher columbus and his son ferdinand encountered the cacao bean on columbuss fourth mission to the americas on  august  when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cacao beans among other goods for trade
spanish conquistador hernán cortés may have been the first european to encounter it as the frothy drink was part of the afterdinner routine of montezuma
josé de acosta a spanish jesuit missionary who lived in peru and then mexico in the later th century wrote of its growing influence on the spaniards
loathsome to such as are not acquainted with it having a scum or froth that is very unpleasant to taste
yet it is a drink very much esteemed among the indians wherewith they feast noble men who pass through their country
the spaniards both men and women that are accustomed to the country are very greedy of this chocolaté
they say they make diverse sorts of it some hot some cold and some temperate and put therein much of that chili yea they make paste thereof the which they say is good for the stomach and against the catarrh
while columbus had taken cacao beans with him back to spain chocolate made no impact until spanish friars introduced it to the spanish court
after the spanish conquest of the aztecs chocolate was imported to europe
there it quickly became a court favorite
it was still served as a beverage but the spanish added sugar as well as honey the original sweetener used by the aztecs for chocolate to counteract the natural bitterness
vanilla another indigenous american introduction was also a popular additive with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor
unfortunately these spices tended to unsettle the european constitution the encyclopédie states the pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset ones stomach which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as healthy chocolate
by  chocolate had made its way from spain to austria
by  pope alexander vii had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks
within about a hundred years chocolate established a foothold throughout europe
the new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market as between the early s and late s the laborious and slow processing of the cacao bean was manual
cacao plantations spread as the english dutch and french colonized and planted
with the depletion of mesoamerican workers largely to disease cacao production was often the work of poor wage laborers and african slaves
windpowered and horsedrawn mills were used to speed production augmenting human labor
heating the working areas of the tablemill an innovation that emerged in france in  also assisted in extractionnew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the industrial revolution
in  dutch chemist coenraad van houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate which reduced its bitterness
a few years thereafter in  he created a press to remove about half the natural fat cocoa butter or cacao butter from chocolate liquor which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality
this innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate
known as dutch cocoa this machinepressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when in  english chocolatier joseph fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter
subsequently his chocolate factory frys of bristol england began massproducing chocolate bars frys chocolate cream launched in  and they became very popular
milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the midth century but in  swiss chocolatier daniel peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by henri nestlé with the liquor
in  the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when rudolphe lindt invented the conching machinebesides nestlé several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late th and early th centuries
rowntrees of york set up and began producing chocolate in  after buying out the tuke family business
cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in england by 
manufacturing their first easter egg in  cadbury created the modern chocolate easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes
in milton s hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the worlds columbian exposition in chicago and soon began the career of hersheys chocolates with chocolatecoated caramels
the baker chocolate company which makes bakers chocolate is the oldest producer of chocolate in the united states
in dr james baker and john hannon founded the company in boston
using cocoa beans from the west indies the pair built their chocolate business which is still in operationwhite chocolate was first introduced to the us in  by frederick e hebert of hebert candies in shrewsbury massachusetts near boston after he had tasted white coat candies while traveling in europe
cacao pronounced by the olmecs as kakawa dates to  bc or earlier
the word chocolate entered the english language from spanish in about 
the word entered spanish from the word xocolātl in nahuatl the language of the aztecs
the origin of the nahuatl word is uncertain as it does not appear in any early nahuatl source where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl cacao water
it is possible that the spaniards coined the word perhaps in order to avoid caca a vulgar spanish word for faeces by combining the yucatec mayan word chocol hot with the nahuatl word atl water
another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl meaning beaten drink which may derive from the word for the frothing stick chicoli
the term chocolatier for a chocolate confection maker is attested from 
several types of chocolate can be distinguished
pure unsweetened chocolate often called baking chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions
much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate which combines chocolate with sugar
milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk
in the uk and ireland milk chocolate must contain a minimum of  total dry cocoa solids in the rest of the european union the minimum is 
white chocolate although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color
in  the us food and drug administration established a standard for white chocolate as the common or usual name of products made from cacao fat ie cocoa butter milk solids nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners and other safe and suitable ingredients but containing no nonfat cacao solids
dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture
the us food and drug administration calls this sweet chocolate and requires a  concentration of chocolate liquor
european rules specify a minimum of  cocoa solids
a higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness
semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content
bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar typically a third more cocoa butter and vanilla are added
it has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate but the two are interchangeable in baking
it is also known to last for two years if stored properly
as of  there is no highquality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits
unsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor also known as bitter or baking chocolate
it is unadulterated chocolate the pure ground roasted chocolate beans impart a strong deep chocolate flavor
it is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added
raw chocolate often referred to as raw cacao is always dark and a minimum of  cacao
poorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part called chocolate bloom it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage
it is not toxic and can be safely consumed
roughly twothirds of the entire worlds cocoa is produced in west africa with  sourced from côte divoire where as of  child labor is a common practice to obtain the product
according to the world cocoa foundation in  some  million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood
as of  in the uk most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them to melt mold and package to their own design
according to the wcfs  report the ivory coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world
the two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers
chocolate makers use harvested cacao beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate covering
chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies bars truffles etc
production costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat
cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called chocolate due to the risk of lower demand for their crops
the sequencing in  of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved
due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cacao is grown  degrees north and south of the equator the commercial company mars incorporated and the university of california berkeley are conducting genomic research in  to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates
chocolate is made from cocoa beans the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree theobroma cacao a small  m tall  ft tall evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the americas
recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout south and central america
early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now venezuela
the scientific name theobroma means food of the gods
the fruit called a cacao pod is ovoid  cm  in long and  cm  in wide ripening yellow to orange and weighing about  g  lb when ripe
cacao trees are small understory trees that need rich welldrained soils
they naturally grow within  of either side of the equator because they need about  mm of rainfall a year and temperatures in the range of  to   to 
cacao trees can not tolerate a temperature lower than   f the three main varieties of cacao beans used in chocolate are criollo forastero and trinitario
representing only  of all cocoa beans grown as of  criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market and is native to central america the caribbean islands and the northern tier of south american states
the genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties
criollos are particularly difficult to grow as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree
the flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex low in classic chocolate flavor but rich in secondary notes of long duration
the most commonly grown bean is forastero a large group of wild and cultivated cacaos most likely native to the amazon basin
the african cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero
they are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo
the source of most chocolate marketed forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic chocolate flavor but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors producing quite bland chocolate
trinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero
trinitario originated in trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop
nearly all cacao produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lowergrade trinitario varieties
cacao pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete or by knocking them off the tree using a stick
the beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins allowing access to microorganisms so fermentation of the pectincontaining material can begin
yeasts produce ethanol lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid
the fermentation process which takes up to seven days also produces several flavor precursors eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate tasteit is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe because if the pod is unripe the beans will have a low cocoa butter content or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation resulting in a weak flavor
after fermentation the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth
climate and weather permitting this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven daysthe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility
the beans are cleaned removing twigs stones and other debris roasted and graded
next the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib
finally the nibs are ground and liquefied resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form chocolate liquor
the liquor can be further processed into two components cocoa solids and cocoa butter
chocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture
the basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first are
dark chocolate sugar cocoa butter cocoa liquor and sometimes vanilla
milk chocolate sugar cocoa butter cocoa liquor milk or milk powder and vanilla
white chocolate sugar cocoa butter milk or milk powder and vanilla usually an emulsifying agent such as soy lecithin is added though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain gmofree sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture
some manufacturers are now using pgpr an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel
the texture is also heavily influenced by processing specifically conching see below
the more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added
different manufacturers develop their own signature blends based on the above formulas but varying proportions of the different constituents are used
the finest plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least  cocoa both solids and butter whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 
highquality white chocolate couverture contains only about  cocoa butter
producers of highquality smallbatch chocolate argue that mass production produces badquality chocolate
some massproduced chocolate contains much less cocoa as low as  in many cases and fats other than cocoa butter
vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented andor roasted beansin  the chocolate manufacturers association in the united states whose members include hershey nestlé and archer daniels midland lobbied the food and drug administration fda to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes
currently the fda does not allow a product to be referred to as chocolate if the product contains any of these ingredientsin the eu a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to  vegetable oil and must be labeled as family milk chocolate rather than milk chocolate if it contains  milkaccording to canadian food and drug regulations a chocolate product is a food product that is sourced from at least one cocoa product and contains at least one of the following chocolate bittersweet chocolate semisweet chocolate dark chocolate sweet chocolate milk chocolate or white chocolate
a cocoa product is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains cocoa nibs cocoa liquor cocoa mass unsweetened chocolate bitter chocolate chocolate liquor cocoa lowfat cocoa cocoa powder or lowfat cocoa powder
the penultimate process is called conching
a conche is a container filled with metal beads which act as grinders
the refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat
chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture
the conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect hence the smooth feel in the mouth
the length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate
highquality chocolate is conched for about  hours and lesser grades about four to six hours
after the process is complete the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about  to   to  until final processing
the final process is called tempering
uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye
this causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken
the uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process
the fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms polymorphous crystallization
the primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present
the six different crystal forms have different properties
as a solid piece of chocolate the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance
once heated the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases the melting process
when the heat is removed the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together allowing the chocolate to solidifythe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat
chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperaturemaking chocolate considered good is about forming as many type v crystals as possible
this provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time
to accomplish this the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization
generally the chocolate is first heated to   to melt all six forms of crystals
next the chocolate is cooled to about   which will allow crystal types iv and v to form
at this temperature the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal seeds which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate
the chocolate is then heated to about   to eliminate any type iv crystals leaving just type v after this point any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated
other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well
the most common variant is introducing already tempered solid seed chocolate
the temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency
a sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results
two classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are
working the molten chocolate on a heatabsorbing surface such as a stone slab until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal seeds the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature
stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to inoculate the liquid chocolate with crystals this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to seed the molten chocolatechocolate tempering machines or temperers with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate
in particular continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications
various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by aasted sollich and buhler three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment with a focus now on energy efficiency
in general molten chocolate coming in at  is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about  passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear then warmed slightly to remelt undesirable crystal formations
chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity
ideal storage temperatures are between  and   and  with a relative humidity of less than 
if refrigerated or frozen without containment chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface
various types of blooming effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperlychocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding   while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below   or excess humidity
to distinguish between different types of bloom one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly and if the bloom disappears it is fat bloom
moving chocolate between temperature extremes can result in an oily texture
although visually unappealing chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected
bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolatechocolate is generally stored away from other foods as it can absorb different aromas
ideally chocolates are packed or wrapped and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature
additionally chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper
the glossy shine snap aroma texture and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well
a gram serving of milk chocolate supplies  calories
it is  carbohydrates  as sugar and  as dietary fiber  fat and  protein table
approximately  of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid table
grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source over  of the daily value dv of riboflavin vitamin b and the dietary minerals manganese phosphorus and zinc
chocolate is a good source  dv of calcium magnesium and iron
chocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents theobromine may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus
theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans
however daily intake of  g cocoa  g theobromine by humans has been associated with sweating trembling and severe headache
chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine which have physiological effects in humans but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals including dogs and catsaccording to a  study the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is  ngg which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food
however during cultivation and production chocolate may absorb lead from the environment such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline which is still being used in nigeria
reports from  indicate that chocolate might be a significant source of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high with dark chocolate containing higher amounts and one  g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as  of the daily lead oral limit
chocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate which may increase the risk of kidney stonesa few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children
other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it
research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure
chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases or cognitive abilitiesone tablespoonful  grams of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has  mg of caffeine and a g single serving of dark chocolate has  mg of caffeine
although a single  oz
serving of coffee may contain  mg studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as  mg and a dose as low as  mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performanceexcessive consumption of large quantities of any energyrich food such as chocolate without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity
raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process
manufacturers may add other fats sugars and milk all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate
in comparison to most foods cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants
cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids and alkaloids such as theobromine phenethylamine and caffeine
some manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of cocoa or cacao
this refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar not just the percentage of cocoa solids
the belgian ambao certification mark indicates that no noncocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate
a longstanding dispute between britain on the one hand and belgium and france over british use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in  with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products
this british style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as vegelatechocolates that are organic or fair trade certified carry labels accordingly
in the united states some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as chocolate
in june  in response to consumer concern about the proposal the fda reiterated cacao fat as one of the signature characteristics of the product will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate
chocolate prevalent throughout the world is a steadily growing us billionayear worldwide business
europe accounts for  of the worlds chocolate revenue and the us spent  billion in 
big chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in europe and the us us companies mars and hersheys alone generated  billion a year in chocolate sales and account for twothirds of us production in 
despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally cocoa farmers and labourers in the ivory coast are unaware of the uses of the beans the high cost of chocolate products in the ivory coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population who do not know what it tastes like
chocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge
large manufacturers of chocolate products include cadbury the worlds largest confectionery manufacturer ferrero guylian the hershey company lindt sprüngli mars incorporated milka neuhaus and suchard
guylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells cadbury for its dairy milk and creme egg
the hershey company the largest chocolate manufacturer in north america produces the hershey bar and hersheys kisses
mars incorporated a large privately owned us corporation produces mars bar milky way mms twix and snickers
lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foilwrapped easter bunnies
food conglomerates nestlé sa and kraft foods both have chocolate brands
nestlé acquired rowntrees in  and now markets chocolates under their brand including smarties a chocolate candy and kit kat a chocolate bar kraft foods through its  acquisition of jacobs suchard now owns milka and suchard
in february  kraft also acquired britishbased cadbury frys trebor basset and the fair trade brand green blacks also belongs to the group
the widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation but also because up to  of the  children working in côte divoire the worlds biggest producer of cocoa may be victims of trafficking or slavery
most attention on this subject has focused on west africa which collectively supplies  percent of the worlds cocoa and côte divoire in particular which supplies  percent of the worlds cocoa
thirty percent of children under age  in subsaharan africa are child laborers mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming
major chocolate producers such as nestlé buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoain  salvation army international development said uk stated that  children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the ivory coast of africa where half of the worlds chocolate is made
said uk states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in harsh and abusive conditions for the production of chocolate and an increasing number of healthfood and antislavery organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry
as of  approximately  million children in ghana and côte divoire were involved in farming cocoa carrying heavy loads clearing forests and being exposed to pesticides
according to sona ebai the former secretarygeneral of the alliance of cocoa producing countries i think child labor can not be just the responsibility of industry to solve
i think its the proverbial allhandsondeck government civil society the private sector
and there you need leadership
reported in  a year pilot program conducted by nestlé with  farmers mostly located in côte divoire observed a  decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming
the us department of labor formed the child labor cocoa coordinating group as a publicprivate partnership with the governments of ghana and côte divoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry
the international cocoa initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the child labor monitoring and remediation system intended to monitor thousands of farms in ghana and côte divoire for child labor conditions but the program reached less than  of the child laborers
despite these efforts goals to reduce child labor in west africa by  before  are frustrated by persistent poverty absence of schools expansion of cocoa farmland and increased demand for cocoain april  the cocoa barometer report stated not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sectorwide objective of the elimination of child labor and not even near their commitments of a  reduction of child labor by 
in the s some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries
traditionally africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa which caused poverty to abound
fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system
one solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an agricultural cooperative
cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food clothes and school fees
one of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers
the effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned
in a  article the economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system
chocolate is sold in chocolate bars which come in dark chocolate milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties
some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate such as nuts raisins or crisped rice
chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars which typically contain various confectionary ingredients eg nougat wafers caramel nuts etc
which are coated in chocolate
chocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts such as chocolate cakes chocolate brownies chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies
numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate either as a filling eg mms or as a coating eg chocolatecoated raisins or chocolatecoated peanuts
some nonalcoholic beverages contain chocolate such as chocolate milk hot chocolate and chocolate milkshakes
some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao
chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes
the caffè mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate
cooking or cookery is the art science and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption
cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves to baking in various types of ovens reflecting unique environmental economic and cultural traditions and trends
types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of cooks
cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments
cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat such as in ceviche a traditional south american dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice or orange juice
preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans
it may have started around  million years ago though archaeological evidence for it reaches no more than  million years ago
the expansion of agriculture commerce trade and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients
new inventions and technologies such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling water expanded cooking techniques
some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served
phylogenetic analysis suggests that human ancestors may have invented cooking as far back as  million to  million years ago
reanalysis of burnt bone fragments and plant ashes from the wonderwerk cave in south africa has provided evidence supporting control of fire by early humans by  million years ago
there is evidence that homo erectus were cooking their food as early as  years ago
evidence for the controlled use of fire by homo erectus beginning some  years ago has wide scholarly support
archaeological evidence from  years ago in the form of ancient hearths earth ovens burnt animal bones and flint are found across europe and the middle east
anthropologists think that widespread cooking fires began about  years ago when hearths first appeared
recently the earliest hearths have been reported to be at least  years old
communication between the old world and the new world in the columbian exchange influenced the history of cooking
the movement of foods across the atlantic from the new world such as potatoes tomatoes maize beans bell pepper chili pepper vanilla pumpkin cassava avocado peanut pecan cashew pineapple blueberry sunflower chocolate gourds and squash had a profound effect on old world cooking
the movement of foods across the atlantic from the old world such as cattle sheep pigs wheat oats barley rice apples pears peas chickpeas green beans mustard and carrots similarly changed new world cooking
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries food was a classic marker of identity in europe
in the nineteenthcentury age of nationalism cuisine became a defining symbol of national identity
the industrial revolution brought massproduction massmarketing and standardization of food
factories processed preserved canned and packaged a wide variety of foods and processed cereals quickly became a defining feature of the american breakfast
in the s freezing methods cafeterias and fast food restaurants emerged
most ingredients in cooking are derived from living organisms
vegetables fruits grains and nuts as well as herbs and spices come from plants while meat eggs and dairy products come from animals
mushrooms and the yeast used in baking are kinds of fungi
cooks also use water and minerals such as salt
cooks can also use wine or spirits
naturally occurring ingredients contain various amounts of molecules called proteins carbohydrates and fats
they also contain water and minerals
cooking involves a manipulation of the chemical properties of these molecules
carbohydrates include the common sugar sucrose table sugar a disaccharide and such simple sugars as glucose made by enzymatic splitting of sucrose and fructose from fruit and starches from sources such as cereal flour rice arrowroot and potato
the interaction of heat and carbohydrate is complex
longchain sugars such as starch tend to break down into simpler sugars when cooked while simple sugars can form syrups
if sugars are heated so that all water of crystallisation is driven off then caramelization starts with the sugar undergoing thermal decomposition with the formation of carbon and other breakdown products producing caramel
similarly the heating of sugars and proteins elicits the maillard reaction a basic flavorenhancing technique
an emulsion of starch with fat or water can when gently heated provide thickening to the dish being cooked
in european cooking a mixture of butter and flour called a roux is used to thicken liquids to make stews or sauces
in asian cooking a similar effect is obtained from a mixture of rice or corn starch and water
these techniques rely on the properties of starches to create simpler mucilaginous saccharides during cooking which causes the familiar thickening of sauces
this thickening will break down however under additional heat
types of fat include vegetable oils animal products such as butter and lard as well as fats from grains including maize and flax oils
fats are used in a number of ways in cooking and baking
to prepare stir fries grilled cheese or pancakes the pan or griddle is often coated with fat or oil
fats are also used as an ingredient in baked goods such as cookies cakes and pies
fats can reach temperatures higher than the boiling point of water and are often used to conduct high heat to other ingredients such as in frying deep frying or sautéing
fats are used to add flavor to food eg butter or bacon fat prevent food from sticking to pans and create a desirable texture
edible animal material including muscle offal milk eggs and egg whites contains substantial amounts of protein
almost all vegetable matter in particular legumes and seeds also includes proteins although generally in smaller amounts
mushrooms have high protein content
any of these may be sources of essential amino acids
when proteins are heated they become denatured unfolded and change texture
in many cases this causes the structure of the material to become softer or more friable meat becomes cooked and is more friable and less flexible
in some cases proteins can form more rigid structures such as the coagulation of albumen in egg whites
the formation of a relatively rigid but flexible matrix from egg white provides an important component in baking cakes and also underpins many desserts based on meringue
cooking often involves water and waterbased liquids
these can be added in order to immerse the substances being cooked this is typically done with water stock or wine
alternatively the foods themselves can release water
a favorite method of adding flavor to dishes is to save the liquid for use in other recipes
liquids are so important to cooking that the name of the cooking method used is often based on how the liquid is combined with the food as in steaming simmering boiling braising and blanching
heating liquid in an open container results in rapidly increased evaporation which concentrates the remaining flavor and ingredients this is a critical component of both stewing and sauce making
vitamins and minerals are required for normal metabolism but which the body can not manufacture itself and which must therefore come from external sources
vitamins come from several sources including fresh fruit and vegetables vitamin c carrots liver vitamin a cereal bran bread liver b vitamins fish liver oil vitamin d and fresh green vegetables vitamin k
many minerals are also essential in small quantities including iron calcium magnesium sodium chloride and sulfur and in very small quantities copper zinc and selenium
the micronutrients minerals and vitamins in fruit and vegetables may be destroyed or eluted by cooking
vitamin c is especially prone to oxidation during cooking and may be completely destroyed by protracted cooking
failed verification the bioavailability of some vitamins such as thiamin vitamin b niacin folate and carotenoids are increased with cooking by being freed from the food microstructure
blanching or steaming vegetables is a way of minimizing vitamin and mineral loss in cooking
there are very many methods of cooking most of which have been known since antiquity
these include baking roasting frying grilling barbecuing smoking boiling steaming and braising
a more recent innovation is microwaving
various methods use differing levels of heat and moisture and vary in cooking time
the method chosen greatly affects the end result because some foods are more appropriate to some methods than others
some major hot cooking techniques include
cooking can prevent many foodborne illnesses that would otherwise occur if the food is eaten raw
when heat is used in the preparation of food it can kill or inactivate harmful organisms such as bacteria and viruses as well as various parasites such as tapeworms and toxoplasma gondii
food poisoning and other illness from uncooked or poorly prepared food may be caused by bacteria such as pathogenic strains of escherichia coli salmonella typhimurium and campylobacter viruses such as noroviruses and protozoa such as entamoeba histolytica
bacteria viruses and parasites may be introduced through salad meat that is uncooked or done rare and unboiled water
the sterilizing effect of cooking depends on temperature cooking time and technique used
some food spoilage bacteria such as clostridium botulinum or bacillus cereus can form spores that survive boiling which then germinate and regrow after the food has cooled
this makes it unsafe to reheat cooked food more than once
cooking increases the digestibility of many foods which are inedible or poisonous when raw
for example raw cereal grains are hard to digest while kidney beans are toxic when raw or improperly cooked due to the presence of phytohaemagglutinin which is inactivated by cooking for at least ten minutes at  
food safety depends on the safe preparation handling and storage of food
food spoilage bacteria proliferate in the danger zone temperature range from  to   to  food therefore should not be stored in this temperature range
washing of hands and surfaces especially when handling different meats and keeping raw food separate from cooked food to avoid crosscontamination are good practices in food preparation
foods prepared on plastic cutting boards may be less likely to harbor bacteria than wooden ones
washing and disinfecting cutting boards especially after use with raw meat poultry or seafood reduces the risk of contamination
proponents of raw foodism argue that cooking food increases the risk of some of the detrimental effects on food or health
they point out that during cooking of vegetables and fruit containing vitamin c the vitamin elutes into the cooking water and becomes degraded through oxidation
peeling vegetables can also substantially reduce the vitamin c content especially in the case of potatoes where most vitamin c is in the skin
however research has shown that in the specific case of carotenoids a greater proportion is absorbed from cooked vegetables than from raw vegetables
german research in  showed significant benefits in reducing breast cancer risk when large amounts of raw vegetable matter are included in the diet
the authors attribute some of this effect to heatlabile phytonutrients
sulforaphane a glucosinolate breakdown product which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer however much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled
the usda has studied retention data for  vitamins  minerals and alcohol for approximately  foods for various cooking methods
in a human epidemiological analysis by richard doll and richard peto in  diet was estimated to cause a large percentage of cancers
studies suggest that around  of cancer deaths may be avoidable by changes to the diet
some of these cancers may be caused by carcinogens in food generated during the cooking process although it is often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase cancer risk
many foods such as beef steak and broccoli contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens
several studies published since  indicate that cooking meat at high temperature creates heterocyclic amines hcas which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans
researchers at the national cancer institute found that human subjects who ate beef rare or mediumrare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef mediumwell or welldone
while avoiding meat or eating meat raw may be the only ways to avoid hcas in meat fully the national cancer institute states that cooking meat below   creates negligible amounts of hcas
also microwaving meat before cooking may reduce hcas by  by reducing the time needed for the meat to be cooked at high heat
nitrosamines are found in some food and may be produced by some cooking processes from proteins or from nitrites used as food preservatives cured meat such as bacon has been found to be carcinogenic with links to colon cancer
ascorbate which is added to cured meat however reduces nitrosamine formation
research has shown that grilling barbecuing and smoking meat and fish increases levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah
in europe grilled meat and smoked fish generally only contribute a small proportion of dietary pah intake since they are a minor component of diet most intake comes from cereals oils and fats
however in the us grilledbarbecued meat is the second highest contributor of the mean daily intake of a known pah carcinogen benzoapyrene at  after bread cereal and grain at 
baking grilling or broiling food especially starchy foods until a toasted crust is formed generates significant concentrations of acrylamide a known carcinogen from animal studies its potential to cause cancer in humans at normal exposures is uncertain
public health authorities recommend reducing the risk by avoiding overly browning starchy foods or meats when frying baking toasting or roasting them
cooking dairy products may reduce a protective effect against colon cancer
researchers at the university of toronto suggest that ingesting uncooked or unpasteurized dairy products see also raw milk may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer
mice and rats fed uncooked sucrose casein and beef tallow had onethird to onefifth the incidence of microadenomas as the mice and rats fed the same ingredients cooked
this claim however is contentious
according to the food and drug administration of the united states health benefits claimed by raw milk advocates do not exist
the small quantities of antibodies in milk are not absorbed in the human intestinal tract says barbara ingham phd associate professor and extension food scientist at the university of wisconsinmadison
there is no scientific evidence that raw milk contains an antiarthritis factor or that it enhances resistance to other diseases
heating sugars with proteins or fats can produce advanced glycation end products glycotoxins
deep fried food in restaurants may contain high level of trans fat which is known to increase levels of lowdensity lipoprotein that in turn may increase risk of heart diseases and other conditions
however many fast food chains have now switched to transfatfree alternatives for deepfrying
the application of scientific knowledge to cooking and gastronomy has become known as molecular gastronomy
this is a subdiscipline of food science
important contributions have been made by scientists chefs and authors such as herve this chemist nicholas kurti physicist peter barham physicist harold mcgee author shirley corriher biochemist author heston blumenthal chef ferran adria chef robert wolke chemist author and pierre gagnaire chef
chemical processes central to cooking include the maillard reaction a form of nonenzymatic browning involving an amino acid a reducing sugar and heat
home cooking has traditionally been a process carried out informally in a home or around a communal fire and can be enjoyed by all members of the family although in many cultures women bear primary responsibility
cooking is also often carried out outside of personal quarters for example at restaurants or schools
bakeries were one of the earliest forms of cooking outside the home and bakeries in the past often offered the cooking of pots of food provided by their customers as an additional service
in the present day factory food preparation has become common with many readytoeat foods being prepared and cooked in factories and home cooks using a mixture of scratch made and factory made foods together to make a meal
the nutritional value of including more commercially prepared foods has been found to be inferior to homemade foods
homecooked meals tend to be healthier with fewer calories and less saturated fat cholesterol and sodium on a per calorie basis while providing more fiber calcium and iron
the ingredients are also directly sourced so there is control over authenticity taste and nutritional value
the superior nutritional quality of homecooking could therefore play a role in preventing chronic disease
cohort studies following the elderly over  years show that adults who cook their own meals have significantly lower mortality even when controlling for confounding variables
homecooking may be associated with comfort food and some commercially produced foods and restaurant meals are presented through advertising or packaging as having been homecooked regardless of their actual origin
this trend began in the s and is attributed to people in urban areas of the us wanting homestyle food even though their schedules and smaller kitchens made cooking harder
a cooking schoola is an institution devoted to education in the art and science of cooking and food preparation
there are many different types of cooking schools around the world some devoted to training professional chefs others aimed at amateur enthusiasts with some being a mixture of the two
amateur cooking schools are often intertwined with culinary tourism in many countries
programs can vary from half a day to several years
some programs lead to an academic degree or a recognized vocational qualification while others do not
many programs include practical experience in the kitchen of a restaurant attached to the school or a period of work experience in a privately owned restaurant
culinary education in the united states is a fairly new concept in relation to culinary education in europe
charles ranhoffer chef of the early fine dining restaurant delmonicos published a national magazine named chef in  which included one of the first calls to establish a training school for cooks in the united states
until this point ranhoffer had been looking to europe to solve his staffing problems however it began to be too expensive and too much work
in  the united states promoted a system similar to the european one in which apprentices would have to complete a hour work commitment in order to become certified as a chef
the first significant private cooking school in america was the boston cooking school which was created in  however one of the most notable was the creation of the culinary institute of america in 
the culinary institute of america brought about a new way to better educate culinary professionals by teaching students the theory behind their future work and also requiring them to complete an week paid internship at an approved restaurant requiring them to create at least  percent of their product from scratch
the school uses mainly handson teaching styles ensuring that students learn through experience
some schools such as le cordon bleu offer programs through which a chef may demonstrate his or her knowledge and skills and be given certification
others such as baltimore international college stratford university johnson and wales university and the culinary institute of america offer programs whereby students gain either an associates or bachelors degree
there are also a few such as ivy tech community college of indiana manchester community college in connecticut los angeles trade technical college in california or where students receive upon graduation not only an associates degree but also certification by the american culinary federation the largest professional chefs organization in north america
in recipes quantities of ingredients may be specified by mass commonly called weight by volume or by count
for most of history most cookbooks did not specify quantities precisely instead talking of a nice leg of spring lamb a cupful of lentils a piece of butter the size of a small apricot and sufficient salt
informal measurements such as a pinch a drop or a hint soupçon continue to be used from time to time
in the us fannie farmer introduced the more exact specification of quantities by volume in her  boston cookingschool cook book
today most of the world prefers metric measurement by weight though the preference for volume measurements continues among home cooks in the united states almost exclusively and the rest of north america
different ingredients are measured in different ways
liquid ingredients are generally measured by volume worldwide
dry bulk ingredients such as sugar and flour are measured by weight in most of the world  g flour and by volume in north america  cup flour
small quantities of salt and spices are generally measured by volume worldwide as few households have sufficiently precise balances to measure by weight
meats are generally specified by weight or count worldwide a  kg chicken four lamb chops
eggs are usually specified by count
vegetables are usually specified by weight or occasionally by count despite the inherent imprecision of counts given the variability in the size of vegetables
in most of the world recipes use the metric system of units litres l and millilitres ml grams g and kilograms kg and degrees celsius
the official spelling litre is used in most englishspeaking nations the notable exception is the united states where the spelling liter is preferred
the usa measures weight in pounds avoirdupois while recipes in the uk tend to include both imperial and metric measures following the advice of the guild of food writers
the usa also uses volume measures based on cooking utensils and premetric measures
the actual values frequently deviate from the utensils on which they were based and there is little consistency from one country to another
in south australia a pint of beer is traditionally  ml while most other states have metricated this value to  ml
the volumetric measures here are for comparison only
see below for the definition of gallon for more details
in addition the cooks cup above is not the same as a coffee cup which can vary anywhere from  to  ml  to  imp fl oz  to  us fl oz or even smaller for espresso
in australia since  metric utensil units have been standardized by law and imperial measures no longer have legal status
however it is wise to measure the actual volume of the utensil measures particularly the australian tablespoon see above since many are imported from other countries with different values
dessertspoons are standardized as part of the metric system at  ml though they are not normally used in contemporary recipes
australia is the only metricated country with a metric tablespoon of  ml unlike other countries that metricated which have a  ml metric tablespoon
in europe older recipes frequently refer to pounds eg
pfund in german pond in dutch livre in french
in each case the unit refers to  g about  more than an avoirdupois pound g
dutch recipes may also use the ons which is  g
with the advent of accurate electronic scales it has become more common to weigh liquids for use in recipes avoiding the need for accurate volumetric utensils
the most common liquids used in cooking are water and milk milk having approximately the same density as water
ml of water weighs  gram so a recipe calling for  ml imperial pint of water can simply be substituted with  g  oz
of water
fluid ounce of water weighs approximately  ounce so a recipe calling for a uk pint  fl oz of water can be substituted with  oz of water
more accurate measurements become important in the large volumes used in commercial food production
also a home cook can use greater precision at times
water at   may be volumetrically measured then weighed to determine an unknown measuringutensil volume without the need for a waterdensity adjustment
the us uses pounds and ounces avoirdupois for weight and us customary units for volume
for measures used in cookbooks published in other nations navigate to the appropriate regional section in traditional measurement systems
measures are classified as either dry measures or fluid measures
some of the fluid and dry measures have similar names but the actual measured volume is quite different
a recipe will generally specify which measurement is required
us recipes are commonly in terms of fluid measures even for dry ingredients
most of these units derive from earlier english units as applied to the us gallon
typically they follow a pattern of binary submultiples where each larger measure consists of two units of the nextsmallest measure
an exception is with the commonly used teaspoon as onethird of a tablespoon
binary submultiples are fractional parts obtained by successively dividing by the number 
thus onehalf onefourth oneeighth onesixteenth and so on are binary submultiples
the system can be traced back to the measuring systems of the hindus and the ancient egyptians who subdivided the hekat about  litres into parts of ​ ​​ ​ ​ and ​  ro or mouthful or about  ml and the hin similarly down to ​  ro using hieratic notation as early as the fifth dynasty of egypt  to  bc thus making the english doubling system at least  years old
the introduction of measures that dont follow the system combined with the dropping from common use of a few measures essential to the continuity of the system dessertspoon wineglass and pottle combined with the redefinition of the teaspoon from ​ to ​ of a fl oz has gradually left the system littleunderstood
however it is still a legal basis for measures in some states such as massachusetts which mandates that glass bottles or jars used for the sale of milk or cream to the consumer shall be of the capacity of one gallon a multiple of the gallon or a binary submultiple of the gallon
metric equivalents are based upon one of two nearly equivalent systems
in the standard system the conversion is that  gallon  cubic inches and  inch  cm giving that a gallon  millilitres exactly
for nutritional labeling on food packages in the us the teaspoon is defined as exactly  ml giving  gallon  ml exactly
this chart uses the former
in domestic cooking bulk solids notably flour and sugar are measured by volume often cups though they are sold by weight at retail
weight measures are used for meat
butter may be measured by either weight ​ lb or volume  tbsp or a combination of weight and volume ​ lb plus  tbsp it is sold by weight but in packages marked to facilitate common divisions by eye
as a subpackaged unit a stick of butter at ​ lb  g is a de facto measure in the us
cookbooks in canada use the same system although pints and gallons would be taken as their imperial quantities unless specified otherwise
following the adoption of the metric system recipes in canada are frequently published with metric conversions
there are a variety of approximate units of measures which are frequently undefined by any official source or which have had conflicting definitions over time yet which are commonly used
the measurement units that are most commonly understood to be approximate are the drop smidgen pinch and dash yet nearly all of the traditional cooking measurement units lack statutory definitions or even any definition by any organization authorized to set standards in the us for example of the table above only the fluid ounce pint quart and gallon are officially defined by the nist
all of the others appear only in conversion guides lacking statutory authority or in nowobsolete publications of the us pharmacopeial convention or usp essentially the apothecaries system which still has authority to define certain drug and supplement standards
the usp has longsince abandoned apothecaries measurements and even now recommends against using teaspoons to measure doses of medicine
note that measurements in this section are in imperial units
british imperial measures distinguish between weight and volume
weight is measured in ounces and pounds avoirdupois as in the us
volume is measured in imperial gallons quarts pints and fluid ounces
the imperial gallon was originally defined as  pounds  kg of water in  and refined as exactly  litres in 
older recipes may well give measurements in cups insofar as a standard cup was used it was usually ​ pint  ml or sometimes ​ pint  ml but if the recipe is one that has been handed down in a family it is just as likely to refer to someones favourite kitchen cup as to that standard
please also note british recipe books tend to refer to ​ pint or  fluid ounces instead of a single cup for volumeamerican cooks using british recipes and vice versa need to be careful with pints and fluid ounces
a us pint is  ml while a uk pint is  ml about  larger
a us fluid ounce is ​ of a us pint  ml a uk fluid ounce is ​ uk pint  ml
this makes an imperial pint equivalent to  us fluid ounces
on a larger scale perhaps for institutional cookery an imperial gallon is eight imperial pints  imp fl oz  litres whereas the us gallon is eight us pints  us fl oz  litres
the metric system was officially adopted in the uk for most purposes in the th century and both imperial and metric are taught in schools and used in books
it is now mandatory for the sale of food to also show metric
however it is not uncommon to purchase goods which are measured and labeled in metric but the actual measure is rounded to the equivalent imperial measure ie milk labeled as  ml  pint
in september  the eu with directive ec deregulated prescribed metric packaging of most products leaving only wines and liqueurs subject to prescribed euwide prepackaging legislation the law relating to labelling of products remaining unchanged
volume measures of compressible ingredients have a substantial measurement uncertainty in the case of flour of about 
some volumebased recipes therefore attempt to improve the reproducibility by including additional instructions for measuring the correct amount of an ingredient
for example a recipe might call for  cup brown sugar firmly packed or  heaping cups flour
a few of the more common special measuring methods
firmly packed
with a spatula a spoon or by hand the ingredient is pressed as tightly as possible into the measuring devicelightly packed
the ingredient is pressed lightly into the measuring device only tightly enough to ensure no air pocketseven level
a precise measure of an ingredient discarding all of the ingredient that rises above the rim of the measuring device
sweeping across the top of the measure with the back of a straight knife or the blade of a spatula is a common leveling methodrounded
allowing a measure of an ingredient to pile up above the rim of the measuring device naturally into a soft rounded shapeheaping heaped
the maximum amount of an ingredient which will stay on the measuring devicesifted
this instruction may be seen in two different ways with two different meanings before the ingredient as  cup sifted flour indicates the ingredient should be sifted into the measuring device and normally leveled while after the ingredient as  cup flour sifted denotes the sifting should occur after measurementsuch special instructions are unnecessary in weightbased recipes

a cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients techniques and dishes and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region
regional food preparation traditions customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a particular region
a cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade they can even be made into distinct ingredients themselves when they become popular within a region take for example japanese rice in japanese cuisine and new mexico chile in new mexican cuisine
religious food laws can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine such as hinduism in indian cuisine sikhism in punjabi cuisine buddhism in east asian cuisine islam in middle eastern cuisine and judaism in jewish cuisine and israeli cuisine
some factors that have an influence on a regions cuisine include the areas climate the trade among different countries religious or sumptuary laws and culinary culture exchange
for example a tropical diet may be based more on fruits and vegetables while a polar diet might rely more on meat and fish
the areas climate in large measure determines the native foods that are available
in addition climate influences food preservation
for example foods preserved for winter consumption by smoking curing and pickling have remained significant in world cuisines for their altered gustatory properties
the trade among different countries also largely affects a regions cuisine
dating back to the ancient spice trade seasonings such as cinnamon cassia cardamom ginger and turmeric were important items of commerce in the earliest evolution of trade
cinnamon and cassia found their way to the middle east at least  years ago
certain foods and food preparations are required or proscribed by the religiousness or sumptuary laws such as islamic dietary laws and jewish dietary laws
culinary culture exchange is also an important factor for cuisine in many regions japans first substantial and direct exposure to the west came with the arrival of european missionaries in the second half of the th century
at that time the combination of spanish and portuguese game frying techniques with an east asian method for cooking vegetables in oil led to the development of tempura the popular japanese dish in which seafood and many different types of vegetables are coated with batter and deep fried
cuisine dates back to the antiquity
as food began to require more planning there was an emergence of meals that situated around culture
cuisines evolve continually and new cuisines are created by innovation and cultural interaction
one recent example is fusion cuisine which combines elements of various culinary traditions while not being categorized per any one cuisine style and generally refers to the innovations in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the s
nouvelle cuisine new cuisine is an approach to cooking and food presentation in french cuisine that was popularized in the s by the food critics henri gault who invented the phrase and his colleagues andré gayot and christian millau in a new restaurant guide the gaultmillau or le nouveau guide
citation needed molecular cuisine is a modern style of cooking which takes advantage of many technical innovations from the scientific disciplines molecular cooking
the term was coined in  by the french inra chemist hervé this because he wanted to distinguish it from the name molecular gastronomy a scientific activity that was introduced by him and the late oxford physicist nicholas kurti in 
it is also named as multi sensory cooking modernist cuisine culinary physics and experimental cuisine by some chefs
besides international trade brings new food stuffs including ingredients to existing cuisines and leads to changes
the introduction of hot pepper to china from south america around the end of the th century greatly influencing sichuan cuisine which combines the original taste with use of sichuan pepper with the taste of newly introduced hot pepper and creates a unique mala flavor thats mouthnumbingly spicy and pungent
a global cuisine is a cuisine that is practiced around the world and can be categorized according to the common use of major food stuffs including grains produce and cooking fats
regional cuisines can vary based on availability and usage of specific ingredients local cooking traditions and practices as well as overall cultural differences
such factors can be moreorless uniform across wide swaths of territory or vary intensely within individual regions
for example in central and north south america corn maize both fresh and dried is a staple food and is used in many different ways
in northern europe wheat rye and fats of animal origin predominate while in southern europe olive oil is ubiquitous and rice is more prevalent
in italy the cuisine of the north featuring butter and rice stands in contrast to that of the south with its wheat pasta and olive oil
in some parts of china rice is the staple while in others this role is filled by noodles and bread
throughout the middle east and mediterranean common ingredients include lamb olive oil lemons peppers and rice
the vegetarianism practiced in much of india has made pulses crops harvested solely for the dry seed such as chickpeas and lentils as important as wheat or rice
from india to indonesia the extensive use of spices is characteristic coconuts and seafood are also used throughout the region both as food stuffs and as seasonings
african cuisines use a combination of locally available fruits cereals and vegetables as well as milk and meat products
in some parts of the continent the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk curd and whey products
in much of tropical africa however cows milk is rare and can not be produced locally owing to various diseases that affect livestock
the continents diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits dishes and preparation techniques of its manifold populations
typical ethiopian and eritrean cuisine injera pancakelike bread and several kinds of wat stew

asian cuisines are many and varied and include east asian cuisine south asian cuisine southeast asian cuisine central asian cuisine and west asian cuisine
ingredients common to east asia and southeast asia due to overseas chinese influence include rice ginger garlic sesame seeds chilies dried onions soy and tofu with stir frying steaming and deep frying being common cooking methods
while rice is common to most regional cuisines in asia different varieties are popular in the different regions basmati rice is popular in south asia jasmine rice in southeast asia and longgrain rice in china and shortgrain rice in japan and korea
curry is also a common ingredient found in south asia southeast asia and east asia notably japanese curry however they are not popular in west asian and central asian cuisines
those curry dishes with origins in south asia usually have a yogurt base with origins in southeast asia a coconut milk base and in east asia a stewed meat and vegetable base
south asian cuisine and southeast asian cuisine are often characterized by their extensive use of spices and herbs native to the tropical regions of asia
due to guangdongs location on the southern coast of china fresh live seafood is a specialty in cantonese cuisine
such markets selling seafood are found across east asia
traditional north indian vegetarian thali with various curries from india
various curry dishes are found across south asia
a market stall at thanin market in chiang mai thailand selling readycooked food
market stalls selling food are found across southeast asia
a tajik feast
a large feast is commonly associated with cultures of central asia
typical assyrian cuisine an example of a type of meal found in west asia
european cuisine alternatively western cuisine include the cuisines of europe and other western countries
european cuisine includes that of europe and to some extent russia as well as nonindigenous cuisines of north america australasia oceania and latin america
the term is used by east asians to contrast with east asian styles of cooking
when used in english the term may refer more specifically to cuisine in continental europe in this context a synonym is continental cuisine especially in british english

oceanian cuisines include australian cuisine new zealand cuisine and the cuisines from many other islands or island groups throughout oceania
australian cuisine consists of immigrant angloceltic derived cuisine and bushfood prepared and eaten by native aboriginal australian peoples and various newer asian influences
new zealand cuisine also consists of european inspired dishes such as pavlova and native maori cuisine
across oceania staples include the kumura sweet potato and taro which wasis a staple from papua new guinea to the south pacific
on most islands in the south pacific fish are widely consumed because of the proximity to the ocean

the cuisines of the americas are found across north and south america and are based on the cuisines of the countries from which the immigrant people came primarily europe
however the traditional european cuisine has been adapted by the addition of many local and native ingredients and many techniques have been added to traditional foods as well
native american cuisine is prepared by indigenous populations across the continent and its influences can be seen on multiethnic latin american cuisine
many staple foods eaten across the continent such as corn maize beans and potatoes have native origins
the regional cuisines are north american cuisine mexican cuisine central american cuisine south american cuisine and caribbean cuisine

the word denature means to render food unpleasant or dangerous to consume it is denatured by adding a substance known as a denaturant
aversive agents primarily bitterants and pungent agents are used to produce an unpleasant flavor
for example the bitterant denatonium might be added to food used in a laboratory where such food is not intended for human consumption
a poisonous substance may be added as an even more powerful deterrent
for example methanol is blended with ethanol to produce denatured alcohol
the addition of methanol which is poisonous renders denatured alcohol unfit for consumption as ingesting denatured alcohol may result in serious injury or death
thus denatured alcohol is not subject to the taxes usually levied on the production and sale of alcoholic beverages
aniline was used to denature colza oil in the s
a garde manger pronounced  french for keeper of the food is a cool wellventilated area where cold dishes such as salads hors dœuvres appetizers canapés pâtés and terrines are prepared and other foods are stored under refrigeration
the person in charge of this area is known as the chef garde manger or pantry chef
larger hotels and restaurants may have garde manger staff to perform additional duties such as creating decorative elements of buffet presentation like ice carving and edible centerpieces
the term garde manger originated in prerevolutionary france
at that time maintaining a large supply of food and beverage was an outward symbol of power wealth and status
it is because of this duty of supervising the preserving of food and managing its utilization that many interpret the term garde manger as keeping to eat
the term garde manger is also related to the cold rooms inside castles and manor houses where the food was stored
these food storage areas were usually located in the lower levels since the cool basementlike environment was ideal for storing food
these cold storage areas developed over time into the modern cold kitchenmost merchants who worked outside noble manors at this time were associated with a guild an association of persons of the same trade formed for their mutual aid and protection
guilds would develop training programs for their members thereby preserving their knowledge and skills
charcuterie was the name of a guild that prepared and sold cooked items made from pigs
through this organization the preparation of hams bacon sausages pâtés and terrines were preserved
when the guild system was abolished in  following the french revolution of  garde mangers took on the responsibility for tasks that had formerly been performed by charcutieres who had difficulty competing with the versatile garde mangers due to the limited range of skills involved
the position of butcher first developed as a specialty within the garde manger kitchen
as both the cost of and demand for animal meats increased more space was required for the task of fabricating and portioning the raw meats
this increased need for space was due not only to an upswing in the volume of meat sales but also to the need for separating raw meats from processed foods to avoid crosscontamination and the resulting possibility of foodborne illness
modern garde manger can refer to different things in the professional kitchen
in many restaurants it is a station which is generally an entrylevel cooking position within a restaurant as it often involves preparing salads or other smaller plates which can be heated and quickly plated without significant experience
in other highprofile classically influenced restaurants and hotels the position pertains to the classical preparations which often include pâtés terrines and elaborate aspics
this is a list of cooking techniques commonly used in cooking and food preparation
cooking is the art of preparing food for ingestion commonly with the application of heat
cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world reflecting unique environments economics cultural traditions and trends
the way that cooking takes place also depends on the skill and type of training of an individual cook

culinary arts basics the fundamentals of cooking
mise en place french pronunciation ​mi plas is a french culinary phrase which means putting in place or everything in its place
it refers to the setup required before cooking and is often used in professional kitchens to refer to organizing and arranging the ingredients eg cuts of meat relishes sauces parcooked items spices freshly chopped vegetables and other components that a cook will require for the menu items that are expected to be prepared during a shift
the practice can be applied in home kitchens
in the kitchen the phrase is used as a noun ie the setup of the array of ingredients a verb ie the process of preparing and a state of mind
the terms broader meanings can be applied to classrooms hospitals and elsewhere
the term has also been used outside of cooking psychologists weisberg et al used the phrase to refer to how ones stance towards a given environment places constraints on what one feels able to do within that environment and how these assessments and predispositions impact the process of preparing to act
they used the term in a study of how a school became safer after security measures like metal detectors and bars on the windows were removed leading to the unexpected outcome
outdoor cooking differs substantially from kitchenbased cooking the most obvious difference being lack of an easily defined kitchen area
as a result campers and backpackers have developed a significant body of techniques and specialized equipment for preparing food in outdoors environments
such techniques have traditionally been associated with nomadic cultures such as the berbers of north africa the arab beduins the plains indians and pioneers of north america and have been carried down to and refined in modern times for use during recreational outdoors pursuits
currently much of the work of maintaining and developing outdoor cooking traditions in westernized countries is done by the scouting movement and by wilderness educators such as the national outdoor leadership school and outward bound as well as by writers and cooks closely associated with the outdoors community
the type of food common in outdoors settings is somewhat different compared to household foods and also differs depending on the type of cooking activity
while someone at a public campground may have easy access to a grocery store and be able to prepare plenty of recipes with fresh meat and vegetables someone on an extended trip into the backcountry will not be able to carry large amounts of fresh food due to the extra weight from high water content and will have to rely heavily on food with a low water content such as dried meats and vegetables packaged dehydrated camping foods and starches such as ramen polenta and dried potato flakes
wilderness experts in both categories sometimes make use of locally available wild foods as well particularly wild vegetables and fruit but also occasionally fresh fish and wild game however it is not unusual for camping food especially backcountry food to be partially or totally vegetarian
camping food is often very high in fat and carbohydrates to provide energy for long hikes and hikers much like soldiers must rely heavily on energypacked snacks such as trail mix chocolate energy bars and sports drinks
water can also be at a premium so important parts of a campers pantry include chlorine or iodinebased water disinfectants as well as drink mixes to mask the flavor of the chemical treatment
recipes are often designed with significant planning and home preparation in mind with certain ingredients mixed at home and then cooked on the trail to that end there are a number of providers of freezedried food both ingredients and full meals to the outdoors market and justaddwater instant meals including hot cereals pasta or rice in sauce and instant soup from the supermarket are popular as well
alternatively some wilderness experts advocate bulk rationing in which each hiker is given a selection of raw ingredients and prepares a meal from scratch on the trail
most outdoor cooking is dictated by the foods themselves which are to be cooked
the first five discussions below of direct heat boiling frying grilling and roasting will perhaps describe the cooking methods employed most often in outdoor cooking
these techniques will require only rudimentary commonsensical tools
additional methods described farther below may be of interest only to those foodies who carry their interests into the outdoors for gourmet meals
these advanced methods may require additional equipment or techniques
the most traditional method for outdoor cooking and indeed the oldest form of cooking known to humanity is by means of a campfire
campfires can be used for cooking food by a number of techniques
the techniques for cooking on a campfire are no different from those used for everyday cooking before the invention of stoves or where stoves are still not available
individuals who are backpacking in an area that allows the gathering of firewood may decide to cook on a campfire to avoid the need to carry extra equipment however most campfire cooking is done in outside of wilderness areas
cooking food using a campfire can be tricky for those not accustomed to it also due to risk of fire damage campfires are illegal in many areas so many campers prefer to use a portable stove instead
in backpacking particularly boiling water is the most common kitchen operation undertaken on the trail used for cooking or reconstituting food making hot beverages cleaning up and even sanitizing drinking water
portable stoves are therefore generally rated in terms of how quickly they can boil a liter or other appropriate size of water indeed some commercial stove models are specifically optimized for fast boiling with other operations such as frying or baking being an afterthought
like camp frying pans camp pots are generally made of very lightweight material often aluminum or at a considerable price premium titanium
though less of a worry given the thermal mass of water the camp cook must still take care not to allow food to burn since the pot itself has very little mass to spread the heat out
alternatively a fireproof container eg
mess can bamboo segment or improvised tree bark pot is placed or hung above the fire
possibly the simplest method of cooking over a campfire and one of the most common is to roast food on long skewers that can be held above the flames
this is popular for cooking hot dogs or toasting marshmallows for making smores
hungarians often roast slab bacon szalonna over a campfire
besides skewers and fireplace popcorn popper pie irons too may be used small iron molds with long handles into which can be placed slices of bread with some form of filling which are placed over hot coals to cook
when using meat roasting can have the advantage over grilling in that the grease that drips from the food can be reused
this can be done by placing a fireproof container under the food
grills are simple to use and food being grilled tends to pick up some flavor from the smoke although that is not by design as in a barbecue where the meat is cooked slowly over a period of hours at a significantly lower temperature
grills over a campfire are used in the same way as an ordinary backyard charcoal grill
if the food is simply placed on the grill it may catch fire so it requires constant attention
handheld grills aka broiler that clamp over the food may be used for various tasks like warming food grilling burgers or sausages or making toast
in cases where open fires are not allowed lightweight charcoal grills sometimes considered a type of hibachi are sometimes used for direct grilling of food
frying is not always necessary but is often used for fish or wild game caught while on the trip as well as pancakes and certain kinds of bread and desserts made on the trail
as a general rule the frying medium used in camp cooking is usually either vegetable oil or margarine
normal salted butter may also be appropriate for camp use but unsalted butter or lard may not be due to their shorter shelf life
camp frying pans often lack handles for easy packing with the camp cook using a clamplike device to pick up and move the pan
camp frying pans are generally made out of very thin metal though some campers do use cast iron pans for this purpose as well so extra care must be taken to evenly cook the food especially over the smalldiameter flame of a portable stove
a round the clock technique where the frying pan is moved repeatedly to expose different parts of its base to the flame is the most commonly recommended solution to the problem though it is also possible to use a flame diffuser to achieve the same effect
for campfire use on the other hand some camp cooks prefer a legged castiron pan called a spider which is elevated to allow a small fire directly beneath it
camp cooks making pancakes in a moderatesize pan often simplify their work and speed up their service by pouring enough batter to make one large moderatethickness pancake that takes up the entire pan and then cutting the final product with the spatula to serve individual portions
also camp cooks often replicate toast using a fry pan a bread slice or more or a combination of whole and cut portions are placed in a well greased pan pressed down with spatula flipped and pressed down again
an improvised griddle can be made by putting a flat stone directly on the fire or above it on top of other stones
food is then placed on the stone
putting a baking sheet pan over a furnace can allow for baking which is in turn derived from the concept of the masonry oven
this was common for centuries used to make breads pies and other items and is still popular today particularly among campers who enjoy stuffing their meats
ovens can be made from cast iron sheet metal or aluminum foil covered cardboard box
reflector ovens are metal containers designed to surround an article of food being baked over an open flame and reflect the heat back towards the food
closely associated with the american old west the dutch oven of tradition is a heavy cast iron pot traditionally made with three short legs and a concave cover for holding hot coals on top
while such pots are generally considered too heavy for backpackers dutch ovens are often used in group campouts and cookouts
dutch ovens were traditionally specially designed for camping and such pots often with legs and a handle both for suspending the pot over a fire are still widely available though sometimes at a premium over flatbottomed stovetop models
the oven is placed in a bed of hot coals often from a keyhole fire with additional coals placed on top of the lid which in camp ovens usually has a raised rim to keep the coals from falling off
dutch ovens are made of cast iron or aluminium and are generally not considered suitable for backpacking due to the heavy weight of the pot
dutch ovens are convenient for cooking dishes that take a long time such as stews joints of meat and baked goods
they are not the only option for baking on a campout as devices for baking on portable stoves exist and clay ovens can be constructed at longer encampments
a pot hanging over the fire although picturesque may spill and the rigging may be difficult to construct from found wood
generally this is done with metal rigging much of it identical to that historically used in home fireplaces before the invention of stoves
two vertical iron bars with an iron crosspiece allow pots to be hung at various heights or over different temperatures of fire
griddles grills and skewers can also be hung over the fire
when working with wood one may use two tripods lashed with tripod lashings but the rope will be liable to melt or burn
dovetail joints are more secure but difficult to carve
a good alternative to cooking with a tripod is to cook directly upon the fire itself
to do this properly the fire needs to have a reasonable bed of coals and to have burned down to the point where it is not a roaring fire
while the pot may be set directly upon the coals this is not preferable since that will tend to extinguish the coals
to lift the pot up off the fire often two small logs of similar size may be used on either side of the pot campstyle dutch ovens have three legs built into the pot to perform this function
an alternative is the use of a metal thread or mesh fire basket
this allows continued airflow through the fire while providing optimal heat
the one down side to this form of cooking is that the pots will become blackened with soot and ash which can be difficult to scrub off
the ash and soot build up can be easily avoided by applying a thin layer of dish soap preferably biodegradable to the outside of the pot before cooking
the ash and soot will stick to the soap which is then easily rinsed off later
steaming is possible with plants such as bamboo
in this method a piece of bamboo is set diagonally above a fire
the bamboo is perforated from within between the joints and water is placed in the lowest bamboo segment
food eg
rice is then placed in the top segment which is steamed due to the water evaporating from the heat in the lowest segment
the original form of covered cooking is the earth oven simply a covered pit with a fire built in it demonstrated in techniques such as the polynesian umuhāngi the indian tandoori and the native american clambake
another commonly used technique is the baking of food in aluminum foil packets
food is wrapped inside a durable packet of tin or aluminum foil crimped to seal and placed on or under hot coals
baked potatoes are commonly cooked this way but entire meals can be cooked in one packet
besides aluminum or tin organic material such as leaves of tree nelumbo nucifera lotus dendrocalamus latiflorus munro bamboo aka bambusa oldhamii phragmites plantain taro etc
husks of corn phyllostachys makinoi bamboo etc
and skins of fruit citrus etc
are also frequently employed
tree leaves such as those from the banana tree do not burnignite as they contain enough oil to resist the heat from the flames at least until the frying is complete
the way to adapt recipes where food is wrapped in foil is to use a barrier such as baking or silicone paper between the food and the foil the overall technique is similar to the en papillote technique developed in french cuisine but uses a more robust container
other simple methods include clay wrapping food such as in the kleftiko method used in greek cuisine leaf wrapping and plank grilling where food is cooked on a wooden plank set above the fire
hotstone cooking where food is placed on a heated stone next to or even in the fire or where fireheated stones are dropped into a pot are other methods
longdistance truckers automotive travelers and rally racers have occasionally resorted to cooking on accessible sections of the vehicle engine the book manifold destiny though written to a certain extent as a humor book is considered the authoritative reference on the subject
the food is usually wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil and secured onto the engine block or other hot parts of the engine
in some areas where there is a significant amount of steady lesshazardous volcanic activity lava cooking invented in hawaii is sometimes practiced as a novelty
the food does not come in direct contact with the molten rock instead being wrapped in a moist barrier usually wet tropical leaves such as banana foliage or ti leaves
the wrapper is sacrificial and is chipped or otherwise cleaned off along with the cooled lava before serving
backwoods cooking is a method of cooking without the use of kitchen implements
it commonly takes place in the backwoods often in combination with wild or conventional camping
some variants of backwoods cooking allow the use of items of cookware such as a cooking pot however there are many recipes without any
some backwoods alternatives to cookware include aluminium foil fruit skins and heated stones
traditionally backwoods cooking takes place over a woodburning fire because wood is the most available fuel source in the backwoods
as a result some recipes include information about the intensity of the fire to be used
backwoods cooking is widely practiced within the scouting movement
while it is most associated with scouting today the term backwoods cooking predates scouting by at least  years
within scouting it may also be known as lightweight cooking which may also have a focus on using aluminium foil for cookware for much lighter weight cooking
scouts around the world take part in different backwoods cooking competitions
these competitions are often local in scope group or district competitions but some are held by national scout associations such as that held by the scout association of malta
portable stoves are widely used in areas where fuel such as wood is scarce or there is a significant fire or environmental hazard to building a campfire
such devices usually use a liquid fuel usually a petroleum derivative or some kind of alcohol but gaseous fuels like propane butane and solid fuels such as wood shavings and hexamine are also used depending on the stove design while twoburner models are commonly used for frontcountry campstoves and function much like residential gas stoves backpacking stoves generally put out a much more concentrated and less powerful flame and require lightweight cooking equipment billycans made of aluminum or titanium rather than more typical kitchentype utensils
in addition there are often special techniques for baked goods made on the trail in the absence of specialized camp oven equipment including flipping over the lidded pan while on the heat and the twiggy fire which mimics the use of charcoal on the lid of a dutch oven using a small campfire on the lid of the pan
reflector ovens are placed on the ground next to the fire and gather thermal radiation from it
solar cookers are a type of equipment that are powered by the sun and no other fuel is required creating a positive environmental impact
there are large variations of design and functionality where the parabolic solar cookers offer the highest temperature often more than  degrees f solsource solar stove is an example of a hightemperature solar stove
ceramic grills come in many guises and have been around in simple format since ancient times
many modern cookers sport ornate designs that can be quite beautiful
these grills cook well and efficiently because they retain heat and seal in moisture
most quality grills are weatherproof and can be used yearround to grill bbq smoke and bake
other benefits include fast heating time and a lack of hotspots
they are fuelefficient using a minimum of charcoal and may be safer for children due to the lack of hotspots

outdoor cooking elements can be of danger due to their high flammability and proximity to occupants
use of highly flammable alcohols to refuel portable cookers gas cookers need to be checked for leaks and kept well away from heat and tents in a sheltered and stable setting
most modern tents are made of lightweight synthetic materials that are not fire retardant
fires and flames must properly extinguished and not left unattended
wind can carry hot embers possibly igniting wildfires
in rare occasions portable camping canisters have been known to explode
these can be caused by leaks or overheating around the compressed canister
adequate air ventilation can prevent overheating during use
it is recommended to operate such portable cooking instruments in the open despite the pull of luxury in having them operate inside a tent
a number of incidents involving camping and cooking fires have resulted in fatalities and severe injuries
special precautions are required for camping in bear country because cooking activities and food storage attract these potentially dangerous animals
food preparation and storage must be located a safe distance from sleeping areas so a fire near camp can not be used for cooking
food may need to be stored in bear cans or bear bags hung from a tree or post
other animals may be attracted to food too most notably raccoons squirrels skunks and mice
the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to food preparation
food preparation art form and applied science that includes but is not limited to cooking
art an art one of the arts is a creative endeavor or discipline
culinary art art of preparing and cooking foods
skill learned capacity to carry out predetermined results often with the minimum outlay of time energy or both
meal preparation the process of planning mealsincludes types of ingredients needed and the correct preparation of the ingredients for the food item being made
chef a person who cooks professionally for other people
although over time the term has come to describe any person who cooks for a living traditionally it refers to a highly skilled professional who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation
cooking act of preparing food for eating
it encompasses a vast range of methods tools and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavour or digestibility of food
it generally requires the selection measurement and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result
cuisine specific set of cooking traditions and practices often associated with a specific culture
it is often named after the region or place where its underlying culture is present
a cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade
baking the technique of prolonged cooking of food by dry heat acting by convection normally in an oven but can also be done in hot ashes or on hot stones
appliances like rotimatic also allow automatic baking
blindbaking baking pastry before adding a filling
boiling the rapid vaporization of a liquid which occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding environmental pressure
blanching cooking technique which food substance usually a vegetable or fruit is plunged into boiling water removed after a brief timed interval and finally plunged into iced water or placed under cold running water shocked to halt the cooking process
braising combination cooking method using both moist and dry heat typically the food is first seared at a high temperature and then finished in a covered pot with a variable amount of liquid resulting in a particular flavour
coddling food is heated in water kept just below the boiling point
infusion the process of soaking plant matter such as fruits or tea leaves in a liquid such as water or alcohol so as to impart flavor into the liquid
pressure cooking cooking in a sealed vessel that does not permit air or liquids to escape below a preset pressure which allows the liquid in the pot to rise to a higher temperature before boiling
simmering foods are cooked in hot liquids kept at or just below the boiling point of water but higher than poaching temperature
poaching process of gently simmering food in liquid generally milk stock or wine
steaming boiling water continuously so it vaporizes into steam and carries heat to the food being steamed thus cooking the food
double steaming chinese cooking technique in which food is covered with water and put in a covered ceramic jar and the jar is then steamed for several hours
steeping saturation of a food such as an herb in a liquid solvent to extract a soluble ingredient into the solvent
eg a cup of tea is made by steeping tea leaves in a cup of hot water
stewing food is cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy
vacuum flask cooking
grilling a form of cooking that involves dry heat applied to the surface of food commonly from above or below
barbecuing method of cooking meat poultry and occasionally fish with the heat and hot smoke of a fire smoking wood or hot coals of charcoal

microwave oven type of oven that heats foods quickly and efficiently using microwaves
however unlike conventional ovens a microwave oven does not brown bread or bake food
this makes microwave ovens unsuitable for cooking certain foods and unable to achieve certain culinary effects
additional kinds of heat sources can be added into microwave ovens or microwave packaging so as to add these additional effects
roasting cooking method that uses dry heat whether an open flame oven or other heat source
roasting usually causes caramelization or maillard browning of the surface of the food which is considered by some as a flavor enhancement
grilling applying dry heat to the surface of food by cooking it on a grill a grill pan or griddle
rotisserie meat is skewered on a spit a long solid rod used to hold food while it is being cooked over a fire in a fireplace or over a campfire or while being roasted in an oven
searing technique used in grilling baking braising roasting sautéing etc in which the surface of the food usually meat poultry or fish is cooked at high temperature so a caramelized crust forms
smoking the process of flavoring cooking or preserving food by exposing it to the smoke from burning or smoldering plant materials most often wood
hot smoking will cook and flavor the food while cold smoking only flavors the food

an anvil is a metalworking tool consisting of a large block of metal usually forged or cast steel with a flattened top surface upon which another object is struck or worked
anvils are as massive as is practical because the higher their inertia the more efficiently they cause the energy of striking tools to be transferred to the work piece
in most cases the anvil is used as a forging tool
before the advent of modern welding technology it was a primary tool of metal workers
the great majority of modern anvils are made of cast steel that has been heat treated by either flame or electric induction
inexpensive anvils have been made of cast iron and low quality steel but are considered unsuitable for serious use as they deform and lack rebound when struck
the primary work surface of the anvil is known as the face
it is generally made of hardened steel and should be flat and smooth with rounded edges for most work
any marks on the face will be transferred to the work
also sharp edges tend to cut into the metal being worked and may cause cracks to form in the workpiece
the face is hardened and tempered to resist the blows of the smiths hammer so the anvil face does not deform under repeated use
a hard anvil face also reduces the amount of force lost in each hammer blow
hammers tools and work pieces of hardened steel should never directly strike the anvil face with full force as they may damage it this can result in chipping or deforming of the anvil face
the horn of the anvil is a conical projection used to form various round shapes and is generally unhardened steel or iron
the horn is used mostly in bending operations
it also is used by some smiths as an aid in drawing down stock making it longer and thinner
some anvils mainly european are made with two horns one square and one round
also some anvils are made with side horns or clips for specialized work
the step is the area of the anvil between the horn and the face
it is soft and is used for cutting its purpose is to prevent damaging the steel face of the anvil by conducting such operations there and so as not to damage the cutting edge of the chisel though many smiths shun this practice as it will damage the anvil over time
there have also been other additions to the anvil such as an upsetting block this is used to upset steel generally in long stripsbars as it is placed between the feet of the anvil
upsetting is a technique often used by blacksmiths for making the steel workpiece short and thick having probably been originally long and thin
the hardy hole is a square hole into which specialized forming and cutting tools called hardy tools are placed
it is also used in punching and bending operations
the pritchel hole is a small round hole that is present on most modern anvils
some anvils have more than one
it is used mostly for punching
at times smiths will fit a second tool to this hole to allow the smith more flexibility when using more than one anvil tool
an anvil needs to be placed upon a sturdy base made from an impact and fire resistant material
it requires being fastened firmly to the base so it will not move when struck with a hammer
a loose anvil is extremely unsafe as it can fall off the base and is an ineffective forging tool
common methods of attaching an anvil are spikes chains steel or iron straps clips bolts where there are holes provided and cables
a smith would use whatever was at hand as long as it held the anvil firmly in place
the anvil is placed as near to the forge as is convenient generally no more than one step from the forge to prevent heat loss in the work piece
the most common base traditionally was a hard wood log or large timber buried several feet into the floor of the forge shop
this was done to make the anvil immobile when heavy forging and bending were done upon the anvil
in the industrial era cast iron bases became available
they had the advantage of adding additional weight to the anvil making it more stable while making the anvil movable
these bases are highly sought after by collectors today
when concrete became widely available there was a trend to make steel reinforced anvil bases by some smiths though this practice has largely been abandoned
in more modern times many anvils have been placed upon bases fabricated from steel often a short thick section of a large ibeam
in addition bases have been made from dimensional lumber bolted together to form a large block or steel drums full of oilsaturated sand to provide a damping effect
in recent times tripod bases of fabricated steel have become popular with some smiths
there are many designs for anvils which are often tailored for a specific purpose or to meet the needs of a particular smith
for example there were anvils specifically made for farriers general smiths cutlers chain makers armorers saw tuners coach makers coopers and many other types of metal workers
most of these anvil types look similar but some are radically different
saw maker anvils for instance are generally a large rectangular block of steel
bladesmith anvils tend to be rectangular with a hardy and pritchel but no horn
such designs have originated in diverse geographic locations
the common blacksmiths anvil is made of either forged or cast steel forged wrought iron with a hard steel face or cast iron with a hard steel face
cast iron anvils are not used for forging as they are incapable of standing up to the impact and will crack and dent
also cast iron anvils without a hard steel face do not have the rebound that a harder anvil would and will tire out the smith
historically some anvils have been made with a smooth top working face of hardened steel welded to a cast iron or wrought iron body though this manufacturing method is no longer in use
at one end the common smiths anvil has a projecting conical bick beak horn used for hammering curved work pieces
the other end is typically called the heel
occasionally the other end is also provided with a bick partly rectangular in section
most anvils made since the late th century also have a hardy hole and a pritchel hole where various tools such as the anvilcutter or hot chisel can be inserted and held by the anvil
some anvils have several hardy and pritchel holes to accommodate a wider variety of hardy tools and pritchels
an anvil may also have a softer pad for chisel work
an anvil for a power hammer is usually supported on a massive anvil block sometimes weighing over  tons for a ton hammer this again rests on a strong foundation of timber and masonry or concrete
an anvil may have a marking indicating its weight manufacturer or place of origin
americanmade anvils were often marked in pounds
european anvils are sometimes marked in kilograms
english anvils were often marked in hundredweight the marking consisting of three numbers indicating hundredweight quarter hundredweight and pounds
for example a  if such an anvil existed would be lb lb  lb  lb  kg
cheap anvils made from inferior steel or cast iron and often sold at retail hardware stores are considered unsuitable for serious use and are often derisively referred to as asos or anvil shaped objects
 amateur smiths have used lengths of railroad rail forklift tines or even simple blocks of steel as makeshift anvils
a metalworking vise may have a small anvil integrated into its design
anvils were first made of stone as a lithic stone tool then bronze and later wrought iron
as steel became more readily available anvils were faced with it
this was done to give the anvil a hard face and to stop the anvil from deforming from impact
many regional styles of anvils evolved through time from the simple block that was first used by smiths
the majority of anvils found today in the us are based on the london pattern anvil of the midth century
the wrought iron steel faced anvil was produced up until the early th century
through the th and very early th centuries this method of construction evolved to produce extremely high quality anvils
the basic process involved forgewelding billets of wrought iron together to produce the desired shape
the sequence and location of the forgewelds varied between different anvil makers and the kind of anvil being made
at the same time cast iron anvils with steel faces were being made in the united states
at the dawn of the th century solid cast steel anvils began to be produced as well as two piece forged anvils made from closed die forgings
modern anvils are generally made entirely from steel
there are many references to anvils in ancient greek and egyptian writings including homers works
they have been found at the calico early man site in north america
anvils have since lost their former commonness along with the smiths who used them
mechanized production has made cheap and abundant manufactured goods readily available
the oneoff handmade products of the blacksmith are less economically viable in the modern world while in the past they were an absolute necessity
however anvils are still used by blacksmiths and metal workers of all kinds in producing custom work
they are also essential to the work done by farriers
application of the principles of the anvil predate historical human practice there being a fair number of examples among various species of animals
some of the most thoroughly documented ethological examples of tool use by animals in the wild were of chimpanzees observed using hammers of wood or stone to crack nuts with logs or rocks serving as anvils
less formally birds such as some species of thrush have been known for centuries to crack the shells of the snails they feed on by striking them on rocks
other species of birds have similar habits notably some of the tropical pittas and individual birds of many such species have their own particular anvils where their discarded shell middens accumulate
anvils being by some definitions proto or borderline tools not directly manipulated and not detached from the substrate some workers argue that their use is less demanding of brain power than more sophisticated tools and they accordingly are likely to be used by organisms of a wider range of organisation of the central nervous system than say probes hammers hooks and scoops
the latter would be limited to species with correspondingly advanced mental powers
certainly anvil use occurs very widely in nature ranging from fishes that break open the shells of molluscs much as thrushes do to sea otters that bring stones to the surface and drift on their backs holding the stones on their chests as anvils on which they break open clams and similar hardshelled prey
gulls of various species some crows and large birds of prey smash open hard food items such as bones and tortoises by dropping them onto rocks
anvil firing is the practice of firing an anvil into the air using gunpowder
it has been popular in california the eastern united states and the southern united states much like how fireworks are used today
there is a growing interest in reenacting this ancient tradition in the us which has now spread to england
a typical metalworkers anvil with horn at one end and flat face at the other is a standard prop for cartoon gags as the epitome of a heavy and clumsy object that is perfect for dropping onto an antagonist
this visual metaphor is common for example in warner brothers looney tunes and merrie melodies shorts such as those with wile e coyote and the road runner
anvils in cartoons were also referenced in an episode of gilmore girls where one of the main characters tries to have a conversation about where did all the anvils go
a reference to their falling out of use on a general scale
animaniacs made frequent gags on the topic throughout its run even having a kingdom named anvilania whose sole national product is anvils
hephaestus the blacksmith of the greek gods used an anvil when metalworking on hercules 
dwarves were blacksmiths who used anvils for metalworking on cslewiss the chronicles of narnia most iconically on the magicians nephew and prince caspian as well as on jrr
tolkiens the hobbit
anvils have been used as percussion instruments in several famous musical compositions including
wagners ring des nibelungen is notable in using the anvil as pitched percussion
the vast majority of extant works use the anvil as unpitched
however tuned anvils are available as musical instruments albeit unusual
these are not to be confused with the sawyers anvils used to tune big circular saw blades
steel anvils are used for tuning for use as musical instruments because those based partly on cast iron and similar materials give a duller sound this is actually valued in industry as pure steel anvils are troublesomely noisy though energetically more efficient
the hammer and anvil have enjoyed varying popularity in orchestral roles
robert donington pointed out that sebastian virdung notes them in his book of  and martin agricola includes it in his list of instruments musica instrumentalis deudsch  largely as a compliment to pythagoras
in premodern or modern times anvils occasionally appear in operatic works by berlioz bizet gounod verdi and wagner for example
commonly pairs of anvils tuned a third apart are used
in practice modern orchestras commonly substitute a brake drum or other suitable steel structure that is easier to tune than an actual anvil although a visibly convincing anvilshaped prop may be shown as desired
in das rheingold wagner scored for nine little six midsized and three large anvils but orchestras seldom can afford instrumentation on such a scale
a blacksmith is a metalsmith who creates objects from wrought iron or steel by forging the metal using tools to hammer bend and cut cf
tinsmith
blacksmiths produce objects such as gates grilles railings light fixtures furniture sculpture tools agricultural implements decorative and religious items cooking utensils and weapons
there was an historical opposition between the heavy work of the blacksmith and the more delicate operation of a whitesmith who usually worked in gold silver pewter or the finishing steps of fine steel
the place where a blacksmith works is called variously a smithy a forge or a blacksmiths shop
while there are many people who work with metal such as farriers wheelwrights and armorers in former times the blacksmith had a general knowledge of how to make and repair many things from the most complex of weapons and armor to simple things like nails or lengths of chain
the black in blacksmith refers to the black firescale a layer of oxides that forms on the surface of the metal during heating
the origin of smith is debated it may come from the old english word smythe meaning to strike or it may have originated from the protogerman smithaz meaning skilled worker
blacksmiths work by heating pieces of wrought iron or steel until the metal becomes soft enough for shaping with hand tools such as a hammer an anvil and a chisel
heating generally takes place in a forge fueled by propane natural gas coal charcoal coke or oil
some modern blacksmiths may also employ an oxyacetylene or similar blowtorch for more localized heating
induction heating methods are gaining popularity among modern blacksmiths
color is important for indicating the temperature and workability of the metal
as iron heats to higher temperatures it first glows red then orange yellow and finally white
the ideal heat for most forging is the bright yelloworange color that indicates forging heat
because they must be able to see the glowing color of the metal some blacksmiths work in dim lowlight conditions but most work in welllit conditions
the key is to have consistent lighting but not too bright
direct sunlight obscures the colors
the techniques of smithing can be roughly divided into forging sometimes called sculpting welding heattreating and finishing
forging the process smiths use to shape metal by hammering differs from machining in that forging does not remove material
instead the smith hammers the iron into shape
even punching and cutting operations except when trimming waste by smiths usually rearrange metal around the hole rather than drilling it out as swarf
forging uses seven basic operations or techniques
drawing down
shrinking a type of upsetting
bending
upsetting
swaging
punching
forge weldingthese operations generally require at least a hammer and anvil but smiths also use other tools and techniques to accommodate oddsized or repetitive jobs
drawing lengthens the metal by reducing one or both of the other two dimensions
as the depth is reduced or the width narrowed the piece is lengthened or drawn out
as an example of drawing a smith making a chisel might flatten a square bar of steel lengthening the metal reducing its depth but keeping its width consistent
drawing does not have to be uniform
a taper can result as in making a wedge or a woodworking chisel blade
if tapered in two dimensions a point results
drawing can be accomplished with a variety of tools and methods
two typical methods using only hammer and anvil would be hammering on the anvil horn and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer
another method for drawing is to use a tool called a fuller or the peen of the hammer to hasten the drawing out of a thick piece of metal
the technique is called fullering from the tool
fullering consists of hammering a series of indentations with corresponding ridges perpendicular to the long section of the piece being drawn
the resulting effect looks somewhat like waves along the top of the piece
then the smith turns the hammer over to use the flat face to hammer the tops of the ridges down level with the bottoms of the indentations
this forces the metal to grow in length and width if left unchecked much faster than just hammering with the flat face of the hammer
heating iron to a forging heat allows bending as if it were a soft ductile metal like copper or silver
bending can be done with the hammer over the horn or edge of the anvil or by inserting a bending fork into the hardy hole the square hole in the top of the anvil placing the work piece between the tines of the fork and bending the material to the desired angle
bends can be dressed and tightened or widened by hammering them over the appropriately shaped part of the anvil
some metals are hot short meaning they lose their tensile strength when heated
they become like plasticine although they may still be manipulated by squeezing an attempt to stretch them even by bending or twisting is likely to have them crack and break apart
this is a problem for some blademaking steels which must be worked carefully to avoid developing hidden cracks that would cause failure in the future
though rarely handworked titanium is notably hot short
even such common smithing processes as decoratively twisting a bar are impossible with it
upsetting is the process of making metal thicker in one dimension through shortening in the other
one form is to heat the end of a rod and then hammer on it as one would drive a nail the rod gets shorter and the hot part widens
an alternative to hammering on the hot end is to place the hot end on the anvil and hammer on the cold end
punching may be done to create a decorative pattern or to make a hole
for example in preparation for making a hammerhead a smith would punch a hole in a heavy bar or rod for the hammer handle
punching is not limited to depressions and holes
it also includes cutting slitting and drifting all done with a chisel
the five basic forging processes are often combined to produce and refine the shapes necessary for finished products
for example to fashion a crosspeen hammer head a smith would start with a bar roughly the diameter of the hammer face the handle hole would be punched and drifted widened by inserting or passing a larger tool through it the head would be cut punched but with a wedge the peen would be drawn to a wedge and the face would be dressed by upsetting
as with making a chisel since it is lengthened by drawing it would also tend to spread in width
a smith would therefore frequently turn the chiseltobe on its side and hammer it back down upsetting it to check the spread and keep the metal at the correct width
or if a smith needed to put a degree bend in a bar and wanted a sharp corner on the outside of the bend they would begin by hammering an unsupported end to make the curved bend
then to fatten up the outside radius of the bend one or both arms of the bend would need to be pushed back to fill the outer radius of the curve
so they would hammer the ends of the stock down into the bend upsetting it at the point of the bend
they would then dress the bend by drawing the sides of the bend to keep the correct thickness
the hammering would continue upsetting and then drawing until the curve had been properly shaped
in the primary operation was the bend but the drawing and upsetting are done to refine the shape
welding is the joining of the same or similar kind of metal
a modern blacksmith has a range of options and tools to accomplish this
the basic types of welding commonly employed in a modern workshop include traditional forge welding as well as modern methods including oxyacetylene and arc welding
in forge welding the pieces to join are heated to what is generally referred to as welding heat
for mild steel most smiths judge this temperature by color the metal glows an intense yellow or white
at this temperature the steel is near molten
any foreign material in the weld such as the oxides or scale that typically form in the fire can weaken it and cause it to fail
thus the mating surfaces to be joined must be kept clean
to this end a smith makes sure the fire is a reducing fire a fire where at the heart there is a great deal of heat and very little oxygen
the smith also carefully shapes mating faces so that as they come together foreign material squeezes out as the metal is joined
to clean the faces protect them from oxidation and provide a medium to carry foreign material out of the weld the smith sometimes uses flux typically powdered borax silica sand or both
the smith first cleans parts to be joined with a wire brush then puts them in the fire to heat
with a mix of drawing and upsetting the smith shapes the faces so that when finally brought together the center of the weld connects first and the connection spreads outward under the hammer blows pushing out the flux if used and foreign material
the dressed metal goes back in the fire is brought near to welding heat removed from the fire and brushed
flux is sometimes applied which prevents oxygen from reaching and burning the metal during forging and it is returned to the fire
the smith now watches carefully to avoid overheating the metal
there is some challenge to this because to see the color of the metal the smith must remove it from the fire exposing it to air which can rapidly oxidize it
so the smith might probe into the fire with a bit of steel wire prodding lightly at the mating faces
when the end of the wire sticks on to the metal it is at the right temperature a small weld forms where the wire touches the mating face so it sticks
the smith commonly places the metal in the fire so he can see it without letting surrounding air contact the surface
note that smiths dont always use flux especially in the uk
now the smith moves with rapid purpose quickly taking the metal from the fire to the anvil and bringing the mating faces together
a few light hammer taps bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux and finally the smith returns the work to the fire
the weld begins with the taps but often the joint is weak and incomplete so the smith reheats the joint to welding temperature and works the weld with light blows to set the weld and finally to dress it to the shape
depending on the intended use of the piece a blacksmith may finish it in a number of ways
a simple jig a tool that the smith might only use a few times in the shop may get the minimum of finishing a rap on the anvil to break off scale and a brushing with a wire brush
files bring a piece to final shape removing burrs and sharp edges and smoothing the surface
heat treatment and casehardening achieve the desired hardness
the wire brush as a hand tool or power tool can further smooth brighten and polish surfaces
grinding stones abrasive paper and emery wheels can further shape smooth and polish the surfacea range of treatments and finishes can inhibit oxidation and enhance or change the appearance of the piece
an experienced smith selects the finish based on the metal and on the intended use of the item
finishes include among others paint varnish bluing browning oil and wax
a blacksmiths striker is an assistant frequently an apprentice whose job is to swing a large sledgehammer in heavy forging operations as directed by the blacksmith
in practice the blacksmith holds the hot iron at the anvil with tongs in one hand and indicates where to strike the iron by tapping it with a small hammer in the other hand
the striker then delivers a heavy blow to the indicated spot with a sledgehammer
during the th century and into the st century this role has become increasingly unnecessary and automated through the use of trip hammers or reciprocating power hammers
when iron ore is smelted into usable metal a certain amount of carbon is usually alloyed with the iron
charcoal is almost pure carbon
the amount of carbon significantly affects the properties of the metal
if the carbon content is over  the metal is called cast iron because it has a relatively low melting point and is easily cast
it is quite brittle however and can not be forged so therefore not used for blacksmithing
if the carbon content is between  and  the resulting metal is tool grade steel which can be heat treated as discussed above
when the carbon content is below  the metal is either wrought iron wrought iron is not smelted and can not come from this process or mild steel
the terms are never interchangeable
in preindustrial times the material of choice for blacksmiths was wrought iron
this iron had a very low carbon content and also included up to  of glassy iron silicate slag in the form of numerous very fine stringers
this slag content made the iron very tough gave it considerable resistance to rusting and allowed it to be more easily forge welded a process in which the blacksmith permanently joins two pieces of iron or a piece of iron and a piece of steel by heating them nearly to a white heat and hammering them together
forge welding is more difficult with modern mild steel because it welds in a narrower temperature band
the fibrous nature of wrought iron required knowledge and skill to properly form any tool which would be subject to stress
modern steel is produced using either the blast furnace or arc furnaces
wrought iron was produced by a laborintensive process called puddling so this material is now a difficulttofind specialty product
modern blacksmiths generally substitute mild steel for making objects traditionally of wrought iron
sometimes they use electrolyticprocess pure iron
many blacksmiths also incorporate materials such as bronze copper or brass in artistic products
aluminum and titanium may also be forged by the blacksmiths process
each material responds differently under the hammer and must be separately studied by the blacksmith
iron is a naturally occurring metallic element
it is almost never found in its native form pure iron in nature
it is usually found as an oxide or sulfide with many other impurity elements mixed in
wrought iron is the purest form of iron generally encountered or produced in quantity
it may contain as little as  carbon by weight
from its traditional method of manufacture wrought iron has a fibrous internal texture
quality wroughtiron blacksmithing takes the direction of these fibers into account during forging since the strength of the material is stronger in line with the grain than across the grain
most of the remaining impurities from the initial smelting become concentrated in silicate slag trapped between the iron fibers
this slag produces a lucky side effect during forgewelding
when the silicate melts it makes wrought iron selffluxing
the slag becomes a liquid glass that covers the exposed surfaces of the wrought iron preventing oxidation which would otherwise interfere with the successful welding process
steel is an alloy of iron and between  and  carbon by weight
the presence of carbon allows steel to assume one of several different crystalline configurations
macroscopically this is seen as the ability to turn the hardness of a piece of steel on and off through various processes of heattreatment
if the concentration of carbon is held constant this is a reversible process
steel with a higher carbon percentage may be brought to a higher state of maximum hardness
cast iron is iron that contains between  to  carbon by weight
there is so much carbon present that the hardness can not be switched off
hence cast iron is a brittle metal which can break like glass
cast iron can not be forged without special heat treatment to convert it to malleable ironsteel with less than  carbon content can not be hardened enough by simple heattreatment to make useful hardenedsteel tools
hence in what follows wroughtiron lowcarbonsteel and other soft unhardenable iron varieties are referred to indiscriminately as just iron
in hindu mythology tvastar also known as vishvakarma is the blacksmith of the devas
the earliest references of tvastar can be found in the rigveda
hephaestus latin vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods in greek and roman mythology
a supremely skilled artisan whose forge was a volcano he constructed most of the weapons of the gods as well as beautiful assistants for his smithy and a metal fishingnet of astonishing intricacy
he was the god of metalworking fire and craftsmen
in celtic mythology the role of smith is held by eponymous their names do mean smith characters goibhniu irish myths of the tuatha dé danann cycle or gofannon welsh myths the mabinogion
in the nart mythology of the caucasus the hero known to the ossetians as kurdalægon and the circassians as tlepsh is a blacksmith and skilled craftsman whose exploits exhibit shamanic features sometimes bearing comparison to those of the scandinavian deity odin
one of his greatest feats is acting as a type of male midwife to the hero xamyc who has been made the carrier of the embryo of his son batraz by his dying wife the watersprite lady isp who spits it between his shoulder blades where it forms a womblike cyst
kurdalaegon prepares a type of tower or scaffold above a quenching bath for xamyc and when the time is right lances the cyst to liberate the infant hero batraz as a newborn babe of whitehot steel whom kurdalægon then quenches like a newly forged sword
the anglosaxon wayland smith known in old norse as völundr is a heroic blacksmith in germanic mythology
the poetic edda states that he forged beautiful gold rings set with wonderful gems
he was captured by king níðuðr who cruelly hamstrung him and imprisoned him on an island
völundr eventually had his revenge by killing níðuðrs sons and fashioning goblets from their skulls jewels from their eyes and a brooch from their teeth
he then raped the kings daughter after drugging her with strong beer and escaped laughing on wings of his own making boasting that he had fathered a child upon her
seppo ilmarinen the eternal hammerer blacksmith and inventor in the kalevala is an archetypal artificer from finnish mythologytubalcain is mentioned in the book of genesis of the torah as the original smith
ogun the god of blacksmiths warriors hunters and others who work with iron is one of the pantheon of orisha traditionally worshipped by the yoruba people of nigeria
gold silver and copper all occur in nature in their native states as reasonably pure metals humans probably worked these metals first
these metals are all quite malleable and humans initial development of hammering techniques was undoubtedly applied to these metals
during the chalcolithic era and the bronze age humans in the mideast learned how to smelt melt cast rivet and to a limited extent forge copper and bronze
bronze is an alloy of copper and approximately  to  tin
bronze is superior to just copper by being harder being more resistant to corrosion and by having a lower melting point thereby requiring less fuel to melt and cast
much of the copper used by the mediterranean world came from the island of cyprus
most of the tin came from the cornwall region of the island of great britain transported by seaborne phoenician and greek traders
copper and bronze can not be hardened by heattreatment they can only be hardened by cold working
to accomplish this a piece of bronze is lightly hammered for a long period of time
the localized stresscycling causes work hardening by changing the size and shape of the metals crystals
the hardened bronze can then be ground to sharpen it to make edged tools
clocksmiths as recently as the th century used work hardening techniques to harden the teeth of brass gears and ratchets
tapping on just the teeth produced harder teeth with superior wearresistance
by contrast the rest of the gear was left in a softer and tougher state more capable of resisting cracking
bronze is sufficiently corrosionresistant that artifacts of bronze may last thousands of years relatively unscathed
accordingly museums frequently preserve more examples of bronze age metalwork than examples of artifacts from the much younger iron age
buried iron artifacts may completely rust away in less than  years
examples of ancient iron work still extant are very much the exception to the norm
concurrent with the advent of alphabetic characters in the iron age humans became aware of the metal iron
in earlier ages irons qualities in contrast to those of bronze were not generally understood though
iron artifacts composed of meteoric iron have the chemical composition containing up to  nickel
as this source of this iron is extremely rare and fortuitous little development of smithing skills peculiar to iron can be assumed to have occurred
that we still possess any such artifacts of meteoric iron may be ascribed to the vagaries of climate and the increased corrosionresistance conferred on iron by the presence of nickel
during the north polar exploration of the early th century inughuit northern greenlandic inuit were found to be making iron knives from two particularly large nickeliron meteors
one of these meteors was taken to washington dc where it was remitted to the custody of the smithsonian institution
the hittites of anatolia first discovered or developed the smelting of iron ores around  bc
they seem to have maintained a near monopoly on the knowledge of iron production for several hundred years but when their empire collapsed during the eastern mediterranean upheavals around  bc the knowledge seems to have escaped in all directions
in the iliad of homer describing the trojan war and bronze age greek and trojan warriors most of the armor and weapons swords and spears are stated to have been of bronze
iron is not unknown however as arrowheads are described as iron and a ball of iron is listed as a prize awarded for winning a competition
the events described probably occurred around  bc but homer is thought to have composed this epic poem around  bc so exactitude must remain suspect
when historical records resume after the  bc upheavals and the ensuing greek dark age iron work and presumably blacksmiths seem to have sprung like athena fullygrown from the head of zeus
very few artifacts remain due to loss from corrosion and reuse of iron as a valuable commodity
what information exists indicates that all of the basic operations of blacksmithing were in use as soon as the iron age reached a particular locality
the scarcity of records and artifacts and the rapidity of the switch from bronze age to iron age is a reason to use evidence of bronze smithing to infer about the early development of blacksmithing
it is uncertain when iron weapons replaced bronze weapons because the earliest iron swords did not significantly improve on the qualities of existing bronze artifacts
unalloyed iron is soft does not hold an edge as well as a properly constructed bronze blade and needs more maintenance
iron ores are more widely available than the necessary materials to create bronze however which made iron weapons more economical than comparable bronze weapons
small amounts of steel are often formed during several of the earliest refining practices and when the properties of this alloy were discovered and exploited steel edged weapons greatly outclassed bronze
iron is different from most other materials including bronze in that it does not immediately go from a solid to a liquid at its melting point
ho is a solid ice at  c  f and a liquid water at  c  f
iron by contrast is definitely a solid at   but over the next   it becomes increasingly plastic and more taffylike as its temperature increases
this extreme temperature range of variable solidity is the fundamental material property upon which blacksmithing practice depends
another major difference between bronze and iron fabrication techniques is that bronze can be melted
the melting point of iron is much higher than that of bronze
in the western europe the mideast tradition the technology to make fires hot enough to melt iron did not arise until the th century when smelting operations grew large enough to require overly large bellows
these produced blastfurnace temperatures high enough to melt partially refined ores resulting in cast iron
thus cast iron frying pans and cookware did not become possible in europe until  years after the introduction of iron smelting
china in a separate developmental tradition was producing cast iron at least  years before this
although iron is quite abundant good quality steel remained rare and expensive until the industrial developments of bessemer process et al
in the s
close examination of blacksmithmade antique tools clearly shows where small pieces of steel were forgewelded into iron to provide the hardened steel cutting edges of tools notably in axes adzes chisels etc
the reuse of quality steel is another reason for the lack of artifacts
the romans who ensured that their own weapons were made with good steel noted in the th century bc that the celts of the po river valley had iron but not good steel
the romans record that during battle their celtic opponents could only swing their swords two or three times before having to step on their swords to straighten them
on the indian subcontinent wootz steel was and continues to be produced in small quantities
in southern asia and western africa blacksmiths form endogenous castes that sometimes speak distinct languages
in the medieval period blacksmithing was considered part of the set of seven mechanical arts
prior to the industrial revolution a village smithy was a staple of every town
factories and massproduction reduced the demand for blacksmithmade tools and hardware
the original fuel for forge fires was charcoal
coal did not begin to replace charcoal until the forests of first britain during the ad th century and then the eastern united states of america during the th century were largely depleted
coal can be an inferior fuel for blacksmithing because much of the worlds coal is contaminated with sulfur
sulfur contamination of iron and steel make them red short so that at red heat they become crumbly instead of plastic
coal sold and purchased for blacksmithing should be largely free of sulfur
european blacksmiths before and through the medieval era spent a great deal of time heating and hammering iron before forging it into finished articles
although they were unaware of the chemical basis they were aware that the quality of the iron was thus improved
from a scientific point of view the reducing atmosphere of the forge was both removing oxygen rust and soaking more carbon into the iron thereby developing increasingly higher grades of steel as the process was continued
during the eighteenth century agents for the sheffield cutlery industry scoured the british countryside offering new carriage springs for old
springs must be made of hardened steel
at this time the processes for making steel produced an extremely variable product quality was not ensured at the initial point of sale
springs that had survived cracking through hard use over the rough roads of the time had proven to be of a better quality steel
much of the fame of sheffield cutlery knives shears etc
was due to the extreme lengths the companies took to ensure they used highgrade steel
during the first half of the nineteenth century the us government included in their treaties with many native american tribes that the us would employ blacksmiths and strikers at army forts with the expressed purpose of providing native americans with iron tools and repair servicesduring the early to midnineteenth century both european armies as well as both the us federal and confederate armies employed blacksmiths to shoe horses and repair equipment such as wagons horse tack and artillery equipment
these smiths primarily worked at a traveling forge that when combined with a limber comprised wagons specifically designed and constructed as blacksmith shops on wheels to carry the essential equipment necessary for their work
lathes patterned largely on their woodturning counterparts had been used by some blacksmiths since the middleages
during the s henry maudslay created the first screwcutting lathe a watershed event that signaled the start of blacksmiths being replaced by machinists in factories for the hardware needs of the populace
samuel colt neither invented nor perfected interchangeable parts but his insistence and other industrialists at this time that his firearms be manufactured with this property was another step towards the obsolescence of metalworking artisans and blacksmiths

as demand for their products declined many more blacksmiths augmented their incomes by taking in work shoeing horses
a shoerofhorses was historically known as a farrier in english
with the introduction of automobiles the number of blacksmiths continued to decrease many former blacksmiths becoming the initial generation of automobile mechanics
the nadir of blacksmithing in the united states was reached during the s when most of the former blacksmiths had left the trade and few if any new people were entering the trade
by this time most of the working blacksmiths were those performing farrier work so the term blacksmith was effectively coopted by the farrier trade
in the final part of the th century forged ironwork continued to decline due to the aforementioned industrial revolution shapes of the elements in the designs of window grilles and other decorative functional items continued to contradict natural forms surfaces begin to be covered in paint cast iron elements are incorporated into the forged designs
main features of neoclassicism ironwork also referred to as louis xvi style and empire style ironwork include smooth straight bars decorative geometric elements double or oval volutes and the usage of elements from classical antiquity meander art wreaths etc
typical for this kind of ironwork is that the ironwork is painted white with gold gilded elements
during the th century various gases natural gas acetylene etc
have also come to be used as fuels for blacksmithing
while these are fine for blacksmithing iron special care must be taken when using them to blacksmith steel
each time a piece of steel is heated there is a tendency for the carbon content to leave the steel decarburization
this can leave a piece of steel with an effective layer of unhardenable iron on its surface
in a traditional charcoal or coal forge the fuel is really just carbon
in a properly regulated charcoalcoal fire the air in and immediately around the fire should be a reducing atmosphere
in this case and at elevated temperatures there is a tendency for vaporized carbon to soak into steel and iron counteracting or negating the decarburizing tendency
this is similar to the process by which a case of steel is developed on a piece of iron in preparation for case hardening
a renewed interest in blacksmithing occurred as part of the trend in doityourself and selfsufficiency that occurred during the s
currently there are many books organizations and individuals working to help educate the public about blacksmithing including local groups of smiths who have formed clubs with some of those smiths demonstrating at historical sites and living history events
some modern blacksmiths who produce decorative metalwork refer to themselves as artistblacksmiths
in  the artists blacksmiths association of north america was formed with  members
by  it had almost  members
likewise the british artist blacksmiths association was created in  with  charter members and had about  members in  and publish for members a quarterly magazine
while developed nations saw a decline and reawakening of interest in blacksmithing in many developing nations blacksmiths continued doing what blacksmiths have been doing for  years making and repairing iron and steel tools and hardware for people in their local area

bladesmithing is the art of making knives swords daggers and other blades using a forge hammer anvil and other smithing tools
bladesmiths employ a variety of metalworking techniques similar to those used by blacksmiths as well as woodworking for knife and sword handles and often leatherworking for sheaths
bladesmithing is an art that is thousands of years old and found in cultures as diverse as china japan india germany korea the middle east spain and the british isles
as with any art shrouded in history there are myths and misconceptions about the process
while traditionally bladesmithing referred to the manufacture of any blade by any means the majority of contemporary craftsmen referred to as bladesmiths are those who primarily manufacture blades by means of using a forge to shape the blade as opposed to knifemakers who form blades by use of the stock removal method although there is some overlap between both crafts
many blade smiths were known by other titles according to the kind of blade that they produced
historically speaking bladesmithing is an art that has survived and thrived over thousands of years
many different parts of the world have different styles of bladesmithing some more wellknown than others
ancient egyptians referred to iron as copper from the heavens because their lack of smelting technology limited their accessible iron supplies to what little native iron they could recover from meteorites
despite irons rarity they gained enough familiarity with ironworking techniques to have used wrought iron in the manufacture of swords and blades as early as  bc
they exported this technique to assyria babylon and greece through trade and as they conquered other lands and were conquered themselves
the protoceltic hallstatt culture th century bc were among the earliest users of iron swords
during the hallstatt period they made swords both in bronze as well as iron with rounded tips
toward the end of the hallstatt period around bc these swords were replaced with short daggers
the la tene culture reintroduced the sword which were very different from the traditional shape and construction of the bronze age and early iron age characterized by a more pointed tip
traditional chinese blades jians are usually of sanmei three plate construction which involved sandwiching a core of hard steel between two plates of softer steel
the central plate protrudes slightly from its surrounding pieces allowing for a sharp edge while the softer spine protects the brittle core
some blades had wumei or five plate construction with two more soft plates being used at the central ridge
bronze jian were often made in a somewhat similar manner in this case an alloy with a high copper content would be used to make a resilient core and spine while the edge would be made from a hightincontent alloy for sharpness and welded onto the rest of the blade
the swordsmiths of china are often credited with the forging technology that was carried to korea and japan allowing swordsmiths in those places to create such weapons as the katana
this technology included folding inserting alloys and differential hardening of the edge which historically has been the most common technique around the world
while the japanese would be more influenced by the chinese dāo singleedged swords of various forms the early japanese swords known as ken are often based on the jian
onesided jians from the tang dynasty provided the basis for various japanese forging styles and techniques
the korean version of the jian is known as the geom or gum and these swords often preserve features found in mingera jian such as openwork pommels and sharply angled tips
korea has a history of swordsmithing dating back  years
citation needed although korea was in close proximity to both japan and china no native systems of swordsmanship and swordmaking developed in korea
korean swords include long swords such as the yeoh do geom and hyup do and curved swords such as samindo
citation needed metal swords of double bladed leaf structure have been found throughout korea dating back to the bronze age
these bronze swords were around  cm in overall length with a short handle

the technology that led to the development of the japanese sword originated in china and was brought to japan by way of korea
the oldest steel swords found in japan date to the fourth or fifth century ad although appearing to be ceremonial in nature samples of these straight blades preserved in the shōsōin were handforged with hardened cutting edges
by the time of the heian period   ad the japanese sword took on its distinctive curved shape as a mounted horseman would have more use for a slashing type of blade as opposed to a thrusting type
these swords were known as tachi
due to the quality of metal found in japan japanese bladesmithing became an extremely rigid precise process involving folding and forgewelding the steel many times over to create a laminated blade
by the time of the kamakura period ad japan was under the rule of a military class and repelling mongol invasions
this became known as the golden era of japanese bladesmithing under emperor toba ii who became a bladesmith himself
after abdicating toba ii summoned japans finest bladesmiths around him in an effort to develop the perfect sword
it was determined that a sword had to be hard in order to maintain a sharp cutting edge yet hard steel is brittle and can shatter under the stress of a heavy blow
swordsmiths in japan found the solution by wrapping a softer lowcarbon steel core such as wrought iron in a jacket of highcarbon steel and then hardening the edge
however under heavy usage the edge would be more prone to chipping than its european counterparts which were typically designed to deal with heavier armor than japanese blades
this was answered by allowing projections of softer steel known as ashi to form in the hardened cutting edge during differential hardening of the blade
the mongol invasions brought with them a need for swords also suited for handtohand combat and the smiths began manufacture of shorter blades to meet this need
it was during the muromachi period that the katana and tantō came into being
by the sixteenth century japanese bladesmithing had become so renowned throughout asia that the japanese turned to large scale manufacturing of swords as an export to china
smiths at sakai also crafted knives for cutting tobacco which had been introduced by the portuguese
the sakai bladesmithing industry received a major boost from the tokugawa shogunate which granted sakai a special seal of approval and enhanced its reputation for quality
the haitorei edict in  banned carrying of swords in public which combined with the decimation of the samurai class caused a heavy decline in the number of swords produced throughout the country
swordmaking was completely banned following world war ii and did not resume until  under heavy restrictions to preserve it solely as an art
in modernday japan a swordsmith is still only allowed to manufacture two swords a month by law for example
as a result many smiths travel to taiwan or china to make extra swords for the export market as foreignmade swords are also illegal in japan
bladesmithing is still practiced in the cities of sakai osaka prefecture and seki gifu prefecture
the germanic migration period peoples also had advanced bladesmithing techniques for their level of technology
migration era smiths would often forgeweld blades of multiple materials and their blades were typically doubleedged and straight
migration era blades were often forged with a hard steel edge wrapped around a pattern welded core
pattern welding was adopted from the neighbouring romans who had employed such technique since the second century ad
bladesmithing was common practice in india during the middle ages
a special type of steel known as wootz or damascus steel was often used in south asia
the term damascus steel can refer to two different types of artefacts
one is the true damascus steel or wootz steel which is a high carbon alloy with tremendous edge retention possibly due to its composition of carbon nanotubes and carbide nanowires with a wavy surface texture originating from the crystalline structure of alloy metals such as tungsten and vanadium elements that occur naturally in iron ore from southern india to the surface during the manufacturing process
this is still in debate as metallurgist john verhoeven at iowa state university believes the nanowires to occur in most steels
the other is a composite structure made by welding together iron and steel to give a visible pattern on the surface called pattern welded steel
although both were referred to as damascus steels true damascus steels were not replicated in europe until 
between the th and th centuries the toledo swordmaking industry enjoyed a great boom to the point where its products came to be regarded as the best in europe
damascus steel was commonly used in the middle east
bladesmithing began declining after the industrial revolution
with improvements in steel production bladesmiths no longer had to forge steel and knives could be machined from flat bars of steel
as cutlery companies moved to mass production of blades and machine tools became more available the art of forging steel began to disappear as knifemakers could grind blades out of existing stock
by the mid th century bladesmithing had been relegated to a cottage industry carried out by a handful of bladesmiths
one of these bladesmiths was william f moran who forged his knives using a coal forge in the manner of a blacksmith using a hammer and anvil to shape the steel
moran began trying to revive the ancient process of forging damascus steel in the late s
however no living bladesmith knew the exact techniques and without a recipe for the process it was in danger of being lost through trial and error he taught himself pattern welding and referred to his end product as damascus steel
in  moran was elected president of the knifemakers guild
the following year he unveiled his damascus knives at the guild show and created a revival of interest in the forged blade and along with the knives he gave away free booklets detailing how he made them to encourage other knifemakers to take up the hammer and anvil
in  he founded the american bladesmith society abs
despite its name this was an international group of knife makers dedicated to preserving the forged blade and educating the public about traditional bladesmithing techniques
the handful of traditional bladesmiths in the s rose to several hundred by 
the basic art and principles of forging a blade has remained similar for thousands of years and the modern bladesmith uses a variety of tools and techniques in order to produce a blade
forges formerly fed by wood coke or coal are still in use but gas forges are becoming the standard
likewise the smiths hammer is being eclipsed by the use of hydraulic forging presses and power hammers
modern bladesmiths use a variety of steels to produce their blades most commonly high carbon steel such as sae  or sae  the  representing the series carbon steels while   and  reflect the carbon content of the steel tool steel such as o a d other tool or high carbon steels or a variety of steels welded in layers commonly referred to as damascus
when forging the blade material is heated to a high temperature or forging temperature in a forge and shaped with a hammer on an anvil to achieve the desired shape often to near final dimension where very little stock removal if any is required to finish
steel can be folded either to form decorative pattern welded steel or to refine raw steel or as the japanese call it tamahagane
grain size is kept at a minimum as grain growth can happen quite easily if the blade material is overheated
swords and longer blades in modern times are often crafted of  carbon spring steel which is not as hard or brittle as a high carbon steel such as  but is more durable and less prone to breakage and therefore more suitable for longer weapons
carbon spring steel is sometimes used for leaf springs in american trucks making it readily available in the us
in europe en is more commonly used
many bladesmiths are able to forge a special type of steel using a technique called pattern welding producing a metal erroneously referred to as damascus steel
modern patternwelded steel can be highly decorative as well as durable if welded in certain ways with proper steels and is often used in custom knife and swordcrafting
bill moran is said to be the father of modern damascus steel
a coppersmith also known as a brazier is a person who makes artifacts from copper and brass
brass is an alloy of copper and zinc
the term redsmith is used for a tinsmith that uses tinsmithing tools and techniques to make copper items
anthropologists believe copper to be the first metal used by humans due to its softness and ease of manipulation
in antiquity coppers durability and resistance to rust or corrosion proved valuable
coppers relationship with man is thought to date back over six thousand years
coppersmith is one of the few trades that have a mention in the bible
copper was particularly worked in england with ores smelted in wales as early as the s
copper was found in great quantities in north america especially montana as well as archaic copper mines near lake superior which was recorded by a jesuit missionary in 
coppersmithing as a trade benefited strongly from the invention of sheet metal rollers
copper sheet was then available in a much more versatile and easy form for creating copper wares
by the s coppersmiths lived in the american colonies but did not have access to much sheet copper due to the british crowns regulation of copper and other goods to the americas
sheet metal production was prohibited in the colonies as well before the american revolution
most coppersmiths can create from a pattern copper wares from a sheet of copper
they can also repair clean and retin copper cookware interiors
some copper smiths make barrels
some coppersmiths will specialize in specific forms or items such as a particular type of biscuit oven or mug or kettle
in the  and s coppersmiths typically had a few apprentices in various stages of learning the trade working together
apprentices would start learning the trade usually around  or  years old
typical duties of a youth in the copper shop would include tasks such as breaking coke or sal ammoniac blocks scouring copper pieces to prepare them for tinning and polishing hammers and tools
in regions where copper is mined like iberia and india there are a number of centers where the coppersmith trade has flourished
these include
notable copper styles in the uk include newlyn in cornwall and keswick in cumbria
coppersmith work started waning in the late s and early s and those in the sheetmetal trade began doing the coppersmiths work the practices used being similar to those in the plumbing trade
coppersmiths in recent years have turned to pipe work not only in copper but also stainless steel and aluminium particularly in the aircraft industry
copper is generally considered to be a soft metal meaning it can be worked without heating
over a period of working the metal in this way it can workharden
this means that the molecules within the copper are compressed and irregular in their arrangement
this causes stress in the metal and eventually cracking the metal along these stress points
in order for the copper to be worked to any extensive degree it must be annealed
this process involves heating the metal and then rapidly cooling it in water
the cooling stage is known as quenching
by heating the copper the molecules in the metal are relaxed and thus able to align themselves in a more uniform fashion
this allows for easier shaping of the metal
in order to keep this uniformity within the metal it is cooled instantly
this prevents the molecules from moving around and causing tension in the structure of the metal
unlike ferrous metals which must be cooled slowly to anneal copper can be cooled slowly in air or quickly by quenching in water
a forge is a type of hearth used for heating metals or the workplace smithy where such a hearth is located
the forge is used by the smith to heat a piece of metal to a temperature where it becomes easier to shape by forging or to the point where work hardening no longer occurs
the metal known as the workpiece is transported to and from the forge using tongs which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithys anvil while the smith works it with a hammer
sometimes such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands the workpiece is transported to the slack tub which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water
however depending on the metal type it may require an oil quench or a salt brine instead many metals require more than plain water hardening
the slack tub also provides water to control the fire in the forge
a forge typically uses bituminous coal industrial coke or charcoal as the fuel to heat metal
the designs of these forges have varied over time but whether the fuel is coal coke or charcoal the basic design has remained the samea forge of this type is essentially a hearth or fireplace designed to allow a fire to be controlled such that metal introduced to the fire may be brought to a malleable state or to bring about other metallurgical effects hardening annealing and tempering as examples
the forge fire in this type of forge is controlled in three ways amount of air the volume of fuel and shape of the fuelfire
over thousands of years of forging these devices have evolved in one form or another as the essential features of this type of forge
tuyere a pipe through which air can be forced into the fire
bellows or blower a means for forcing air into the tuyere
hearth a place where the burning fuel can be contained over or against the tuyere opening
traditionally hearths have been constructed of mudbrick adobe fired brick stone or later constructed of ironduring operation fuel is placed in or on the hearth and ignited
a source of moving air such as a fan or bellows introduces additional air into the fire through the tuyere
with additional air the fire consumes fuel faster and burns hotter and cleaner smoke can be thought of as escaped potential fuel
a blacksmith balances the fuel and air in the fire to suit particular kinds of work
often this involves adjusting and maintaining the shape of the fire
in a typical coal forge a firepot will be centred in a flat hearth
the tuyere will enter the firepot at the bottom
in operation the hot core of the fire will be a ball of burning coke in and above the firepot
the heart of the fire will be surrounded by a layer of hot but not burning coke
around the unburnt coke will be a transitional layer of coal being transformed into coke by the heat of the fire
surrounding all is a ring or horseshoeshaped layer of raw coal usually kept damp and tightly packed to maintain the shape of the fires heart and to keep the coal from burning directly so that it cooks into coke first
if a larger fire is necessary the smith increases the air flowing into the fire as well as feeding and deepening the coke heart
the smith can also adjust the length and width of the fire in such a forge to accommodate different shapes of work
the major variation from the forge and fire just described is a backdraft where there is no fire pot and the tuyere enters the hearth horizontally from the back wall
coke and charcoal may be burned in the same forges that use coal but since there is no need to convert the raw fuel at the heart of the fire as with coal the fire is handled differently
individual smiths and specialized applications have fostered the development of a variety of forges of this type from the coal forge described above to simpler constructions amounting to a hole in the ground with a pipe leading into it
a gas forge typically uses propane or natural gas as the fuel
one common efficient design uses a cylindrical forge chamber and a burner tube mounted at a right angle to the body
the chamber is typically lined with refractory materials such as a hard castable refractory ceramic or a soft ceramic thermal blanket ex kaowool
the burner mixes fuel and air which are ignited at the tip which protrudes a short way into the chamber lining
the air pressure and therefore heat can be increased with a mechanical blower or by taking advantage of the venturi effect
gas forges vary in size and construction from large forges using a big burner with a blower or several atmospheric burners to forges built out of a coffee can utilizing a cheap simple propane torch
a small forge can even be carved out of a single soft firebrick
the primary advantage of a gas forge is the ease of use particularly for a novice
a gas forge is simple to operate compared to coal forges and the fire produced is clean and consistent
they are less versatile as the fire can not be reshaped to accommodate large or unusually shaped pieces
it is also difficult to heat a small section of a piece
a common misconception is that gas forges can not produce enough heat to enable forgewelding but a welldesigned gas forge is hot enough for any task
a finery forge is a waterpowered mill where pig iron is refined into wrought iron
the anvil serves as a workbench to the blacksmith where the metal to be forged is placed
anvils may seem clunky and heavy but they are a highly refined tool carefully shaped to suit a blacksmiths needs
anvils are made of cast or wrought iron with a tool steel face welded on or of a single piece of cast or forged tool steel
some anvils are made of only cast iron and have no tool steel face
these are not real anvils and will not serve a blacksmith as such because they are too soft
a common term for a cast iron anvil is aso or anvil shaped object
the purpose of a tool steel face on an anvil is to provide what some call rebound as well as being hard and not denting easily from misplaced hammer blows
the term rebound means it projects some of the force of the blacksmiths hammer blows back into the metal thus moving more metal at once than if there were no rebound
a good anvil can project anywhere from  to  of the energy back into the workpiece
the flat top called the face is highly polished and usually has two holes but can have more or less depending on the design
the square hole is called the hardy hole where the square shank of the hardy tool fits
there are many different kinds of hardy tools
the smaller hole is called the pritchel hole used as a bolster when punching holes in hot metal or to hold tools similar to how the hardy tool does but for tools that require being able to turn a degree angle such as a holddown tool for when the blacksmiths tongs can not hold a workpiece as securely as it needs to be
on the front of the anvil there is sometimes a horn that is used for bending drawing out steel and many other tasks
between the horn and the anvil face there is often a small area called a step or a cutting table that is used for cutting hot or cold steel with chisels and hot cut tools without harming the anvils face
marks on the face transfer into imperfections in the blacksmiths work
there are many types of hammer used in a blacksmiths workshop but this will name just a few common ones
hammers can range in shape and weight from half an ounce to nearly  pounds depending on the type of work being done with it
hand hammer used by the smith
ballpeen hammer
crosspeen hammer
straightpeen hammer
rounding hammer
sledge hammer used by the striker
chisels are made of high carbon steel
they are hardened and tempered at the cutting edge while the head is left soft so it will not crack when hammered
chisels are of two types hot and cold chisels
the cold chisel is used for cutting cold metals while the hot chisel is for hot metals
usually hot chisels are thinner and therefore can not be substituted with cold chisels
also many smiths shape chisels as to have a simple twisted handle as to resemble a hammer they can be used at a greater distance away from the hot metals
they are very useful and found throughout the world
tongs are used by the blacksmith for holding hot metals securely
the mouths are custom made by the smith in various shapes to suit the gripping of various shapes of metal
it is not uncommon for a blacksmith to own twenty or more pairs of tongs traditionally a smith would start building their collection during the apprenticeship
there are various types of tongs available in the market
flat tong
rivet or ring tong
straight lip fluted tong
gad tong
fullers are forming tools of different shapes used in making grooves or hollows
they are often used in pairs the bottom fuller has a square shank which fits into the hardy hole in the anvil while the top fuller has a handle
the work is placed on the bottom fuller and the top is placed on the work and struck with a hammer
the top fuller is also used for finishing round corners and for stretching or spreading metal
the hardy tool is a tool with a square shank that fits in a hardy hole
there are many different kinds of hardy tools such as the hot cut hardy used for cutting hot metal on the anvil the fuller tool used for drawing out metal and making grooves bending jigs and too many others to list
a slack tub is usually a large container full of water used by a blacksmith to quench hot metal
the slack tub is principally used to cool parts of the work during forging to protect them or keep the metal in one area from spreading for example nearby hammer blows to harden the steel to tend a coal or charcoal forge and simply to cool the work quickly for easy inspection
in bladesmithing and toolmaking the term will usually be changed to a quench tank because oil or brine is used to cool the metal
the term slack is believed to derive from the word slake as in slaking the heat
drop forging is a process used to shape metal into complex shapes by dropping a heavy hammer with a die on its face onto the workpiece
the workpiece is placed into the forge
then the impact of a hammer causes the heated material which is very malleable to conform to the shape of the die and die cavities
typically only one die is needed to completely form the part
extra space between the die faces causes some of the material to be pressed out of the sides forming flash
this acts as a relief valve for the extreme pressure produced by the closing of the die halves and is later trimmed off of the finished part
the equipment used in the drop forming process is commonly known as a power or drop hammer
these may be powered by air hydraulics or mechanics
depending on how the machine is powered the mass of the ram and the drop height the striking force can be anywhere from  to  pounds
the tools that are used dies and punches come in many different shapes and sizes as well as materials
examples of these shapes are flat and vshaped which are used for opendie forging and single or multipleimpression dies used for closed die forging
the designs for the dies have many aspects to them that must be considered
they all must be properly aligned they must be designed so the metal and the flash will flow properly and fill all the grooves and special considerations must be made for supporting webs and ribs and the parting line location
the materials must also be selected carefully
some factors that go into the material selection are cost their ability to harden their ability to withstand high pressures hot abrasion heat cracking and other such things
the most common materials used for the tools are carbon steel and in some cases nickelbased alloys
the materials that are used most commonly in drop forging are aluminium copper nickel mild steel stainless steel and magnesium
mild steel is the best choice and magnesium generally performs poorly as a drop forging material
a goldsmith is a metalworker who specializes in working with gold and other precious metals
nowadays they mainly specialize in jewellerymaking but historically goldsmiths have also made silverware platters goblets decorative and serviceable utensils and ceremonial or religious items
goldsmiths must be skilled in forming metal through filing soldering sawing forging casting and polishing metal
the trade has very often included jewellerymaking skills as well as the very similar skills of the silversmith
traditionally these skills had been passed along through apprenticeships however more recently jewellery arts schools specializing in teaching goldsmithing and a multitude of skills falling under the jewellery arts umbrella are unavailable
many universities and junior colleges also offer goldsmithing silversmithing and metal arts fabrication as a part of their fine arts curriculum
compared to other metals gold is malleable ductile rare and it is the only solid metallic element with a yellow color
it may easily be melted fused and cast without the problems of oxides and gas that are problematic with other metals such as bronzes for example
it is fairly easy to pressure weld wherein similarly to clay two small pieces may be pounded together to make one larger piece
gold is classified as a noble metal because it does not react with most elements
it usually is found in its native form lasting indefinitely without oxidization and tarnishing
gold has been worked by humans in all cultures where the metal is available either indigenously or imported and the history of these activities is extensive
superbly made objects from the ancient cultures of africa asia europe india north america mesoamerica and south america grace museums and collections throughout the world
some pieces date back thousands of years and were made using many techniques that still are used by modern goldsmiths
techniques developed by some of those goldsmiths achieved a skill level that was lost and remained beyond the skills of those who followed even to modern times
researchers attempting to uncover the chemical techniques used by ancient artisans have remarked that their findings confirm that the high level of competence reached by the artists and craftsmen of these ancient periods who produced objects of an artistic quality that could not be bettered in ancient times and has not yet been reached in modern ones
dubious discuss
in medieval europe goldsmiths were organized into guilds and usually were one of the most important and wealthiest of the guilds in a city
the guild kept records of members and the marks they used on their products
these records when they survive are very useful to historians
citation needed goldsmiths often acted as bankers since they dealt in gold and had sufficient security for the safe storage of valuable items though they were usually restrained from lending at interest which was regarded as usury
in the middle ages goldsmithing normally included silversmithing as well but the brass workers and workers in other base metals normally were members of a separate guild since the trades were not allowed to overlap
many jewelers also were goldsmiths
the sunar caste is one of the oldest communities in goldsmithing in india whose superb gold artworks were displayed at the great exhibition of  in london
in india daivadnya brahmins kshatriya sunar are the goldsmith castes
the printmaking technique of engraving developed among goldsmiths in germany around  who had long used the technique on their metal pieces
the notable engravers of the fifteenth century were either goldsmiths such as master e s or the sons of goldsmiths such as martin schongauer and albrecht dürer
a goldsmith might have a wide array of skills and knowledge at their disposal
gold being the most malleable metal of all offers unique opportunities for the worker
in todays world a wide variety of other metals especially platinum alloys also may be used frequently
karat is pure gold and historically was known as fine gold
because it is so soft however  karat gold is rarely used
it is usually alloyed to make it stronger and to create different colors
depending on the metals used to create the alloy the color can change
this alloyed gold is then stamped with the  mark representing the percentage of gold present in the alloy for commercially used gold
the majority of the jewellery is made with this alloy while a smaller part uses lower golddensity alloys to keep jewelry cheaper
the gold may be cast into some item then usually with the lost wax casting process or it may be used to fabricate the work directly in metal
in the latter case the goldsmith will use a variety of tools and machinery including the rolling mill the drawplate and perhaps swage blocks and other forming tools to make the metal into shapes needed to build the intended piece
then parts are fabricated through a wide variety of processes and assembled by soldering
it is a testament to the history and evolution of the trade that those skills have reached an extremely high level of attainment and skill over time
a fine goldsmith can and will work to a tolerance approaching that of precision machinery but largely using only his eyes and hand tools
quite often the goldsmiths job involves the making of mountings for gemstones in which case they often are referred to as jewelers
jeweller however is a term mostly reserved for a person who deals in jewellery buys and sells and not to be confused with a goldsmith silversmith gemologist diamond cutter and diamond setters
a jobbing jeweller is the term for a jeweller who undertakes a small basic amount of jewellery repair and alteration

a gunsmith is a person who repairs modifies designs or builds guns
the occupation differs from an armorer who usually replaces only worn parts in standard firearms
gunsmiths do modifications and changes to a firearm that may require a very high level of craftsmanship requiring the skills of a toplevel machinist a very skilled woodworker and even an engineer
gunsmiths perform factorylevel repairs and renovations to restore a wellused or deteriorated firearms to new condition
they may make alterations to adapt sporting guns to better fit the individual shooter that may require extensive modifications to the firearms stocks and metal parts
repairs and redesigns may require fabrication and fitting of unavailable parts and assemblies constructed by smiths themselves
gunsmiths may also renew metal finishes or apply decorative carvings or engravings to guns
many gun shops offer gunsmithing service on the premises
gunsmiths may be employed in
to pursue the entirety of this trade a gunsmith must possess skills as a parts fabricator a metalworker or blacksmith a woodworker and an artisan be knowledgeable in shop mathematics ballistics chemistry and materials engineering be knowledgeable in the use and application of a variety of hand power and machinists tools and measuring devices and be capable of working accurately and precisely
those who are self employed in small gunsmith shops must also possess skills as small business operators work effectively with a wide variety of customers and remain abreast of and comply with federal state and local laws ordinances and requirements
citation needed
due to the great breadth of subject matter to be mastered many gunsmiths specialize in only a few of the skills required of the general gunsmith
alternatively some gunsmiths learn many of the skills of the trade but only apply them to a few weapon types eg only pistols only shotguns only specific brands or models
the primary responsibility of a gunsmith is to ensure that guns work and function safely
gunsmiths accomplish this by always properly observing and demonstrating gun safety in their handling procedures both in their own actions and in the actions of their customers and the people around them
they accomplish that task secondly by inspecting guns to ensure safe mechanical operation
gunsmiths use their indepth knowledge of guns to guide inspections either repairing deficiencies or notifying customers of unsafe conditions and taking steps to prevent catastrophic failures
some of the conditions a gunsmith looks for when inspecting a firearm brought to them for repairs are
this list is not comprehensive
many failure modes are dependent on the particular model of firearm
listed in approximate but not exact order of increasing difficulty
while some gunsmiths are general practitioners in this trade some of the more important specializations are
builds guns to customers specification from raw materials and shelf parts
gunsmiths specializing in custom areas can be called upon by professional targetshooters avid sports shooters or anyone that wants custom attributes added to their firearm to create highly accurate or custom looking firearms
a custom gunsmith also builds highend firearms for hunters and shooters with needs and desires that can not be served by standard catalogued firearms offered by gun manufacturers
they may work in partnership with engravers and other specialized artists to produce unique finishes and decorations not possible on regular massproduced firearms
some highly specialized gunsmiths can complete all firearm modifications without anyone else in the industry helping them
this is likely the most highly skilled of gunsmiths as they are required not only to have proficiency in the other areas of gunsmithing but must also be well educated in firearm finishing and machining in order to manufacture the individual components and even springs before assembly takes place
applies various chemical processes browning bluing parkerization among others to the metal parts of guns to develop corrosion resistant surface layers on the steel
they may also apply case hardening to low carbon steel parts
case hardening is a combined chemical and heattreatment process which introduces carbon into the surfaces of low steel alloys that does not contain sufficient carbon to allow total through heat treatment
this carbon rich surface is then heat treated resulting in a thin very hard surface layer with a tough malleable core
this process can be done solely for the mechanical properties hardness and toughness it imparts or by packing the parts in bone charcoal and other chemicals and heating in a heat treatment furnace for varying time periods it is possible to introduce rich colors into the carbonized surface
this type of case hardening known as color case hardening is prized for its rich mottled blues purples browns and grey tones
it is possible with highly skilled craftsmen using highly proprietary processes to control the hues and patterns so closely that one familiar with high grade custom firearms can usually recognize the maker of another shooters firearm solely by the colors and patterns on its parts an important distinction on extremely costly firearms of the highest grade
typically its use is usually restricted to receivers rarely barrels
although providing corrosion resistance the colored surface layers are subject to wear and may also fade with time
antique firearms for sale frequently note the specific percentage of the factory original case coloring remaining on the receiver and lockplates
renewing this color case hardening to the specific patterns of the firearm when it was new has become an important subarea of the gunsmithing field
carves gun stocks from wood usually walnut although birch maple and apple wood among others are frequently seen
fits stocks to the metal parts of the gun receiver and barrel as well as to customers body dimensions
with custom made shotguns the fit to the individual shooter is vital as the shot clouds impact is largely determined by the way the stock fits the shooter
very high grade firearms may have stocks fashioned from very costly blanks mostly of one of the walnut varieties specially chosen for its rare and highly figured grain
the fashioning of high end gunstocks calls for an extremely high level of skill and craftsmanship as the finished product must be pleasing aesthetically fit the shooting customer like an orthopedic device all the while having the ability to withstand high levels of recoil from the firing of many thousands of rounds
wood gunstocks may be fashioned with automated machinery for production firearms while high end gunstocks are hand made using saws chisels gouges rasps and files
the surfaces are then finished by sanding scraping staining oiling or lacquering
this specialization is frequently combined with that of the stockmaker uses checkering tools to create an ornate pattern of small raised diamonds in the wood surfaces which are to be gripped
the checkering tools are in effect tiny saws designed to leave a vshaped groove of approximately  to  degrees in the surface of the wooden gunstock
special checkering tools consisting of two saw blades in parallel are used to set the spacing usually between  and  lines per inch  mm to  mm line width
the area to be checkered is covered by one set of such grooves parallel to each other
a second set of parallel grooves is then executed across the first set at approximately a degree angle leaving the area covered with small pointed diamonds
the edges of the checkered area are frequently ornamented with simple basrelief wood carving frequently variations on the fleurdelis
uses handgravers or diesinkers chisels to cut designs or pictures into the metal surfaces of the gun primarily the receiver
the firearms engraver must first be a highly gifted and capable artist that can first compose the desired design freehand on paper
in many cases the customer must be consulted and must approve the design
in some cases the engraving may incorporate a favorite scene a revered hunting dog or even family members and residences
the engraver must have a through knowledge of human and animal anatomy perspective botany and composition
the smallness and geometry of the parts must also be considered and harmony between all these factors must artistically agree
these designs must then be cut freehand into the tough hardened steel surfaces of the firearm
pneumatically driven engraving systems such as the gravermeister developed by grs tools may be used to replace or supplement handpowered engraving but the guiding of these powered tools is still provided by the artist
other metals especially gold and silver may be inlaid and engraved to further the design
designs usually consist of elaborate scrollwork based upon acanthus leaves or vines or may be of purely abstract spirals
before the development of corrosion resistant surface treatments for steel gun surfaces were engraved to retain more oil to prevent rust
in modern usage guns are engraved purely for artistic reasons
top grade engraving is very expensive but well executed tastefully designed engraving always adds significantly to the value of quality firearms
many of the worlds foremost art museums have highly decorated firearms in their collections because of the high artistic merit and craftsmanship of their engraved chiseled and carved decoration
many books exist on the subject of highly decorated firearms with detailed illustrations showing their art in steel
specializes in work on pistols and revolvers
pistolsmiths should be proficient in a range of skills such as woodworking checkering machining metal finishing and metalworking
they must have an excellent understanding of the mechanical characteristics and function of the guns they work on
often a pistolsmith is called on for extensive customization of a handgun making it better suited for its intended purpose
a good example of this is changing the factory sights for new front and rear sights more suited to the purposes of the user
a wide variety is available as aftermarket parts
target pistols usually start out as standard models but receive extensive reworking by skilled pistolsmiths resulting in a firearm that is capable of much greater accuracy than the standard versions of the same arm
a more advanced job a pistolsmith may called on to perform is to construct a completely hand fitted target arm using a serial numbered frame as the base as required by law with the rest of the parts supplied with excess metal in certain areas by specialist manufacturers so the pistolsmith can fit these parts together to exacting tolerances
using these methods the pistolsmith can build highly accurate firearms that greatly exceed the usual accuracy of standard models of the same model
some gunsmiths used their experience and skills to become smalloperation manufacturers specializing in making only a few types of gun parts for sale to other gunsmiths and gunmakers
some of the more important part categories are
in general gunsmiths develop and expand their skills through years of experience
some common ways to get started in gunsmithing include
basic machinist skills while not limited to gunsmithing are of great help to aspiring gunsmiths
these may include both machine and handtool operations such as metal turning drilling filing stoning or polishing
news of the most highly skilled and talented gunsmiths typically spreads by word of mouth based on the quality of their work
the very best and most talented gunsmiths command premium prices for their services and may have waiting lists booked for several years in advance
in many countries of the world the possession and ownership of firearms by civilians is highly restricted or outright illegal
the practice of gunsmithing is therefore typically restricted licensed or regulated
in some circumstances the only legal firearmsrelated repairs are by individuals trained and employed by the military or police
these individuals are known as armorers
typically their skill level is usually far below that of the private or artisan gunsmith
where the gunsmith frequently has to design manufacture and fit parts ranging from small internal parts and assemblies the armorer usually only has to replace standard interchangeable parts belonging to only one type series or family of militaryrelated firearms
they typically are furnished a large inventory of standard parts that are known to wear and cause malfunctions in the weapons they will encounter and they are simply trained to replace these items until satisfactory function is restored
in the regions where ownership is permitted but limited or restricted to those individuals able to afford the costs of acquiring and owning a firearm the firearms that are allowed tend to be fewer in number and possess levels of craftsmanship and decoration that approach that of an art object instead of simply a device to expel a projectile
gunsmithing in these regions as in germany and britain is concerned with the handcrafting of completely custommade firearms tailored to the requirements of the owner
germany has a tradition of hunting but this is generally a complicated undertaking that limits its participation
firearms possession is highly regulated by the police and most hunters own only one long gun and perhaps a single pistol
one of germanys more distinctive firearm developments is the drilling a multibarrel gun that may incorporate a doublebarreled shotgun above with a highpowered singleshot barrel below
these typically have highly sophisticated breech mechanisms precise fitting and are handengraved by artists specializing in this work
the stocks are usually fitted to the individual and are very expensive wood with highly figured grain
firearms ownership in italy is regulated by the italian government but private ownership of various types and numbers of firearms is allowed after proper vetting of the prospective purchaser
italy has a hunting tradition dating back several centuries
it is the location of some of the finest upland game bird hunting in the world
italy also has a rich history of gunmaking and gunsmithing going back several hundred years with the production of matchlock flintlock and caplock rifles and pistols
the city of brescia italy and specifically its suburb of gardone val trompia is historical home to a number of firearm manufacturers and gunsmiths
italy is noted as one of the worlds leading manufacturing centers of custommade highly crafted double shotguns
the city of gardone is the home of several manufacturing firms that sell their products worldwide with pietro beretta founded in  being the largest and best known
italian shotguns are noted for their precise fitting their precision craftsmanship and the higher grades feature exquisite hand engraving
the brescia area has several training facilities for the education of apprentices gunsmiths for the crafting of high grade shotguns and rifles
there is also a training achedemy for engravers and many freelance engravers are also located in this area
during the tokugawa period in japan starting in the th century the government imposed very restrictive controls on the small number of gunsmiths in the nation thereby ensuring the almost total prohibition of firearms
japan in the postwar period has had gun regulation which is strict in principle
gun licensing is required and is heavily regulated by the national police agency of japan
the weapons law begins by stating no one shall possess a firearm or firearms or a sword or swords and very few exceptions are allowed
the united kingdom makes some of the most expensive handcrafted firearms in the world despite a highly restrictive ownership environment
but as the gunsmiths patrons are usually well able to afford the high ownership fees and stringent storage requirements the price of the arm is only secondary
decoration of these arms typically doublebarreled shotguns is on par with the plates used to mint currency and is priced about the same
several of the other european countries follow this pattern as in italy where the art of the gunsmith has also reached a high level of sophistication
these craftsmen may specialize as in the case of the gun engraver and stockmaker
generally these craftsmen serve long apprenticeships under master gunmakers
they may also be members of guilds which set up apprentice programmes often sponsored by the governments in these countries as highly crafted firearms are important items in the export trade supervise training and conduct exams where the journeymanlevel gunsmiths submit sample firearms of their own work in order to be admitted the guild membership
many of these can only be regarded as gunmakers instead of gunsmiths and do repairs only on the very highest grade firearms
many are able to make a substantial livelihood
in the united states the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf is the primary federal agency overseeing all legitimate businesses that deal with firearms with the exception of firearms made before january   or muzzle loading firearms
the atf is in charge of the licensing of all legitimate firearms dealers and gunsmiths in the us that engage in business with the public
the issuance of a federal firearms license ffl involves a thorough background investigation and an inspection of the gunsmiths premises by an agent of the atf
the atf requires all gunsmiths to record all repairs noting the serial numbers type of firearm caliber or gauge and full particulars of the owner with an accepted form of identification id to be presented and recorded
gunsmiths are required to maintain these records in a permanent nonalterable form
the atf inspects the premises of all licensed gunsmiths with unannounced visits at periodic intervals
the atf is granted the power by the us government to initiate the prosecution in us federal court of gunsmiths that wilfully omit or violate these provisions
punishment can range from losing their ffl and therefore the privilege to engage in any firearmsrelated business to fines and in severe cases such as conspiring to supply the criminal element with black market weaponry imprisonment in a federal prison
gunsmiths who lack sophisticated machine shop capabilities must understand the law
enlisting an unlicensed no ffl machine shop to create gun receivers can be illegal
other common parts such as grips barrels triggers sights magazines recoil springs and stocks can be manufactured freely but all receiver development work does require licensing
generally gunsmiths can not undertake the repair of a firearm they believe is illegally held by a person not permitted to own a firearm a convicted felon for instance or one that otherwise violates the laws where the owner resides
the ownership of firearms in the us is governed by local laws
these laws and regulations vary greatly from state to state county to county city to city and potentially across all jurisdictional lines
additionally modifications to firearms made by gunsmiths are restricted as well
the atf specifies what modifications are permitted or not permitted and to which firearms that may or may not be applied
these laws may also vary by

locksmithing is the science and art of making and defeating locks
locksmithing is a traditional trade and in many countries requires completion of an apprenticeship
the level of formal education legally required varies from country to country from none at all to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer to a full diploma from an engineering college such as in australia in addition to time spent working as an apprentice
a lock is a mechanism that secures buildings rooms cabinets objects or other storage facilities
a smith is a metalworker who shapes metal pieces often using a forge or mould into useful objects or to be part of a more complex structure
thus locksmithing as its name implies is the assembly and designing of locks and their respective keys by hand
most locksmiths use automatic and manual cutting tools to mold keys most are power tools having battery or mains electricity as their power source
locks have been constructed for over  years initially out of wood and later out of metal
historically locksmiths would make the entire lock working for hours hand cutting screws and doing much filework
lock designs became significantly more complicated in the th century and locksmiths often specialized in repairing or designing locks
after the rise of cheap mass production the vast majority of locks are repaired by swapping of parts or likeforlike replacement or upgraded to modern massproduction items
until more recently safes and strongboxes were the exceptions to this and to this day large vaults are custom designed and built at great cost as the cost of this is lower than the very limited scope for mass production would allow and the risk of a copy being obtained and defeated as practice is removedalthough fitting of keys to replace lost keys to automobiles and homes and the changing of keys for homes and businesses to maintain security are still an important part of locksmithing locksmiths today are primarily involved in the installation of higher quality locksets and the design implementation and management of keying and key control systems
most locksmiths also do electronic lock servicing such as making keys for transponderequipped vehicles and the implementation and application of access control systems protecting individuals and assets for many large institutionsin terms of physical security a locksmiths work frequently involves making a determination of the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommending and implementing appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create security layers which exceed the reasonable gain to an intruder or attacker
the more different security layers are implemented the more the requirement for additional skills and knowledge and tools to defeat them all
but because each layer comes at an expense to the customer the application of appropriate levels without exceeding reasonable costs to the customer is often very important and requires a skilled and knowledgeable locksmith to determine
in australia prospective locksmiths are required to take a technical and further education tafe course in locksmithing completion of which leads to issuance of a level  australian qualifications framework certificate and complete an apprenticeship
they must also pass a criminal records check certifying that they are not currently wanted by the police
apprenticeships can last one to four years
course requirements are variable there is a minimal requirements version that requires fewer total training units and a fuller version that teaches more advanced skills but takes more time to complete
apprenticeship and course availability vary by state or territory
in ireland licensing for locksmiths was introduced in  with locksmiths having to obtain a private security authority license
in the uk there is no current government regulation for locksmithing so effectively anyone can trade and operate as a locksmith with no skill or knowledge of the industry
fifteen states in the united states require licensure for locksmithis as described in the table below
locksmiths may be commercial working out of a storefront mobile working out of a vehicle institutional employed by an institution or investigatory forensic locksmiths or may specialize in one aspect of the skill such as an automotive lock specialist a master key system specialist or a safe technician
many are also security consultants but not every security consultant has the skills and knowledge of a locksmith
locksmiths are frequently certified in specific skill areas or to a level of skill within the trade
this is separate from certificates of completion of training courses
in determining skill levels certifications from manufacturers or locksmith associations are usually more valid criteria than certificates of completion
some locksmiths decide to call themselves master locksmiths whether they are fully trained or not and some training certificates appear quite authoritative
the majority of locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware not just locking mechanisms
this includes door closers door hinges electric strikes frame repairs and other door hardware
the issue of full disclosure was first raised in the context of locksmithing in a thcentury controversy regarding whether weaknesses in lock systems should be kept secret in the locksmithing community or revealed to the public
according to a c hobbs
a commercial and in some respects a social doubt has been started within the last year or two whether or not it is right to discuss so openly the security or insecurity of locks
many wellmeaning persons suppose that the discussion respecting the means for baffling the supposed safety of locks offers a premium for dishonesty by showing others how to be dishonest
this is a fallacy
rogues are very keen in their profession and know already much more than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery
rogues knew a good deal about lockpicking long before locksmiths discussed it among themselves as they have lately done
if a lock let it have been made in whatever country or by whatever maker is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been deemed to be surely it is to the interest of honest persons to know this fact because the dishonest are tolerably certain to apply the knowledge practically and the spread of the knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance
it can not be too earnestly urged that an acquaintance with real facts will in the end be better for all parties
some time ago when the reading public was alarmed at being told how london milk is adulterated timid persons deprecated the exposure on the plea that it would give instructions in the art of adulterating milk a vain fear milkmen knew all about it before whether they practised it or not and the exposure only taught purchasers the necessity of a little scrutiny and caution leaving them to obey this necessity or not as they pleased
a metalsmith or simply smith is a craftsperson fashioning useful items for example tools kitchenware tableware jewellery and weapons out of various metals
 smithing is one of the oldest metalworking occupations
shaping metal with a hammer forging is the archetypical component of smithing
often the hammering is done while the metal is hot having been heated in a forge
smithing can also involve the other aspects of metalworking such as refining metals from their ores traditionally done by smelting casting it into shapes founding and filing to shape and size
the prevalence of metalworking in the culture of recent centuries has led smith and its equivalents in various languages to be a common occupational surname german schmidt or schmied portuguese ferreiro ferreira french lefèvre spanish herrero italian fabbri ferrari ferrero ukrainian koval etc
as a suffix smith connotes a meaning of a specialized craftsperson for example wordsmith and tunesmith are nouns synonymous with writer or songwriter respectively
in preindustrialized times smiths held high or special social standing since they supplied the metal tools needed for farming especially the plough and warfare
a metalsmith is one who works with or has the knowledge and the capacity of working with all metals
types of smiths include
the ancient traditional tool of the smith is a forge or smithy which is a furnace designed to allow compressed air through a bellows to superheat the inside allowing for efficient melting soldering and annealing of metals
today this tool is still widely used by blacksmiths as it was traditionally
the term metalsmith often refers to artisans and craftpersons who practice their craft in many different metals including gold copper and silver
jewelers often refer to their craft as metalsmithing and many universities offer degree programs in metalsmithing jewelry enameling and blacksmithing under the auspices of their fine arts programs
machinists are metalsmiths who produce highprecision parts and tools
the most advanced of these tools cnc machines are computer controlled and largely automated

a silversmith is a metalworker who crafts objects from silver
the terms silversmith and goldsmith are not exactly synonyms as the techniques training history and guilds are or were largely the same but the end product may vary greatly as may the scale of objects created
in the ancient near east the value of silver to gold being less allowed a silversmith to produce objects and store these as stock
ogden states that according to an edict written by diocletian in  ad a silversmith was able to charge      or  denarii for material produce per roman pound
at that time guilds of silversmiths formed to arbitrate disputes protect its members welfare and educate the public of the tradesilversmiths in medieval europe and england formed guilds and transmitted their tools and techniques to new generations via the apprentice tradition
silver working guilds often maintained consistency and upheld standards at the expense of innovation
beginning in the th century artisans emigrated to america and experienced fewer restrictions
as a result silver working was one of the trades that helped to inaugurate the technological and industrial history of the united states silverworking shift to industrialization
very exquisite and distinctly designed silverware that goes by the name of swami silver emerged from the stable of watchmaker turned silversmith p orr and sons in the south indian city of madras now chennai during the british rule in 
the beta israel known more widely as the falasha of ethiopia were known for their silversmithing skills
silversmiths saw or cut specific shapes from sterling and fine silver sheet metal and bar stock and then use hammers to form the metal over anvils and stakes
silver is hammered cold at room temperature
as the metal is hammered bent and worked it workhardens
annealing is the heattreatment used to make the metal soft again
if metal is workhardened and not annealed occasionally the metal will crack and weaken the work
silversmiths can use casting techniques to create knobs handles and feet for the hollowware they are making
after forming and casting the various pieces may be assembled by soldering and riveting
during most of their history silversmiths used charcoal or coke fired forges and lungpowered blowpipes for soldering and annealing
modern silversmiths commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources
a newer method is laser beam welding
silversmiths may also work with copper and brass especially when making practice pieces due to those materials having similar working properties and being more affordable than silver
although jewelers also work in silver and gold and many of the techniques for working precious metals overlap the trades of jeweler and silversmith have distinct histories
chainmaking and gemsetting are common practices of jewelers that are not usually considered aspects of silversmiths
the tradition of making iron plate armor was interrupted sometime after the th century
silversmithing and goldsmithing by contrast have an unbroken tradition going back many millennia
the techniques used to make armor today whether for movies or for historical recreation groups are an amalgam of silversmith forming techniques and blacksmith ironhandling techniques
a whitesmith is a metalworker who does finishing work on iron and steel such as filing lathing burnishing or polishing
the term also refers to a person who works with white or lightcoloured metals and is sometimes used as a synonym for tinsmith

the first known description of whitesmith is from  
the iron thus prepared is used both by the white and blacksmiths of this county according as the condition of their wares require it being forged by the former into sithes reapinghooks axes hatchets bills being ground at the blademills to a bright edge they have given this sort of artisans that make them the name of whitesmithswhitesmithing developed as a speciality of blacksmithing in the s when extra time was given to filing and polishing certain products
in  the trade was described by isaac taylor
the business of the smith comprises two branches that of the blacksmith and that of the whitesmith
from the hands of the former come large and coarse articles as horseshoes ploughshares chains iron doors for safes c the whitesmith manufactures articles of neater and more delicate form as locks keys carpenters tools c the blacksmith does little with his iron till he has softened it in the fire of his forge which is a kind of hearth raised to a convenient height from the ground
a large pair of double bellows pours a strong stream of air to the centre of the forge where he has a fire made of small coals or coal dust wetted to make them give a more intense heat
into this fire he thrusts his iron and working his bellows brings it to a white heat in which state it is so soft that a little hammering will reduce it to any required shape
the whitesmith also has a forge but he depends less upon it than upon his files
the articles he manufactures are so numerous that almost every one constitutes a distinct employment one set of men being confined to the making of locks and keys another set to the making of files a third to carpenters tools and so onthe principal manual skills of the whitesmith were in filing and turning the use of lathes
using crosscut files the whitesmith could achieve a flat smooth finish on iron or steel products where the less skilled might only achieve a convex effect
for very large items the whitesmith might even file when red hot using a twoperson operated float file
this profession is also related to a bell hanger and locksmith as they perform much file work
in great britain this type of worker was affiliated with a union
the amalgamated society of whitesmiths was founded in 
it was renamed the amalgamated society of whitesmiths locksmiths bellhangers domestic engineers art metal workers and general iron fitters in  the amalgamated society of whitesmiths locksmiths bellhangers domestic engineers art metal workers and general iron and pipe fitters in  and the amalgamated society of whitesmiths domestic engineers and general pipe fitters in 
in  it merged with the amalgamated society of kitchen range stove grate gas stove hot water art metal and other smiths and fitters connected with the above trades the amalgamated society of kitchen range hot water and general fitters and the birmingham society of hot water and steam engineers to form the national union of operative heating and domestic engineers whitesmiths and general iron workers
james watt employed a whitesmith in the s when working on his experimental steam engine
the first cylinder was made by this whitesmith using hammered iron and solder
although this technique proved insufficient when this whitesmith died soon after watt wrote to john roebuck greatly lamenting the loss of his white iron man
with the industrial revolution in the same way that many blacksmiths became specialised as farriers making horse shoes so many whitesmiths became lorimers making spurs stirrups bridle bits and buckles
typically whitesmiths made products that either required a decorative finish such as fire grates or that needed coldworking such as screws and lathed machine parts
a building or edifice is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place such as a house or factory
buildings come in a variety of sizes shapes and functions and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors from building materials available to weather conditions land prices ground conditions specific uses and aesthetic reasons
to better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures
buildings serve several societal needs primarily as shelter from weather security living space privacy to store belongings and to comfortably live and work
a building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat a place of comfort and safety and the outside a place that at times may be harsh and harmful
ever since the first cave paintings buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression
in recent years interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings and other structures
the word building is both a noun and a verb the structure itself and the act of making it
as a noun a building is a structure that has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place there was a threestorey building on the corner it was an imposing edifice
in the broadest interpretation a fence or wall is a building
however the word structure is used more broadly than building including natural and manmade formations and does not necessarily have walls
structure is more likely to be used for a fence
sturgis dictionary included that building differs from architecture in excluding all idea of artistic treatment and it differs from construction in the idea of excluding scientific or highly skilful treatment
as a verb building is the act of construction
structural height in technical usage is the height to the highest architectural detail on building from streetlevel
depending on how they are classified spires and masts may or may not be included in this height
spires and masts used as antennas are not generally included
the definition of a lowrise vs a highrise building is a matter of debate but generally three storeys or less is considered lowrise
there is clear evidence of homebuilding from around  bc
buildings became common during the neolithic see neolithic architecture
singlefamily residential buildings are most often called houses or homes
multifamily residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called a duplex or an apartment building
a condominium is an apartment that the occupant owns rather than rents
houses may also be built in pairs semidetached in terraces where all but two of the houses have others either side apartments may be built round courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by a piece of ground of varying sizes
houses which were built as a single dwelling may later be divided into apartments or bedsitters they may also be converted to another use eg
an office or a shop
building types may range from huts to multimilliondollar highrise apartment blocks able to house thousands of people
increasing settlement density in buildings and smaller distances between buildings is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from many people wanting to live close to work or similar attractors
other common building materials are brick concrete or combinations of either of these with stone
residential buildings have different names for their use depending if they are seasonal include holiday cottage vacation home or timeshare size such as a cottage or great house value such as a shack or mansion manner of construction such as a log home or mobile home proximity to the ground such as earth sheltered house stilt house or tree house
also if the residents are in need of special care such as a nursing home orphanage or prison or in group housing like barracks or dormitories
historically many people lived in communal buildings called longhouses smaller dwellings called pithouses and houses combined with barns sometimes called housebarns
buildings are defined to be substantial permanent structures so other dwelling forms such as houseboats yurts and motorhomes are dwellings but not buildings
sometimes a group of interrelated and possibly interconnected builds are referred to as a complex for example a housing complex educational complex hospital complex etc
the practice of designing constructing and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of professionals and trades
depending on the size complexity and purpose of a particular building project the project team may include
regardless of their size or intended use all buildings in the us must comply with zoning ordinances building codes and other regulations such as fire codes life safety codes and related standards
vehicles such as trailers caravans ships and passenger aircraft are treated as buildings for life safety purposes
any building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function which includes such elements like heating cooling power and telecommunications water and wastewater etc
especially in commercial buildings such as offices or factories these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space sometimes located in separate areas or double floors false ceilings and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required
systems for transport of people within buildings
systems for transport of people between interconnected buildings
buildings may be damaged during the construction of the building or during maintenance
there are several other reasons behind building damage like accidents such as storms explosions subsidence caused by mining water withdrawal or poor foundations and landslides
 buildings also may suffer from fire damage and flooding in special circumstances
they may also become dilapidated through lack of proper maintenance or alteration work improperly carried out

carpentry is a skilled trade and a craft in which the primary work performed is the cutting shaping and installation of building materials during the construction of buildings ships timber bridges concrete formwork etc
carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did rougher work such as framing but today many other materials are also used and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture building are considered carpentry
in the united states  of carpenters are male and it was the fourth most maledominated occupation in the country in 
in  in the united states there were about  million carpentry positions
carpenters are usually the first tradesmen on a job and the last to leave
carpenters normally framed postandbeam buildings until the end of the th century now this oldfashioned carpentry is called timber framing
carpenters learn this trade by being employed through an apprenticeship training normally  years and qualify by successfully completing that countrys competence test in places such as the united kingdom the united states canada switzerland australia and south africa
it is also common that the skill can be learned by gaining work experience other than a formal training program which may be the case in many places
the word carpenter is the english rendering of the old french word carpentier later charpentier which is derived from the latin carpentarius artifex maker of a carriage  the middle english and scots word in the sense of builder was wright from the old english wryhta cognate with work which could be used in compound forms such as wheelwright or boatwright
in the uk carpentry is more correctly used to describe the skill involved in first fixing of timber items such as construction of roofs floors and timber framed buildings ie
those areas of construction that are normally hidden in a finished building
an easy way to envisage this is that first fix work is all that is done before plastering takes place
the second fix is done after plastering takes place
second fix work the installation of items such as skirting boards architraves doors and windows are generally regarded as carpentry however the offsite manufacture and prefinishing of the items is regarded as joinery
carpentry is also used to construct the formwork into which concrete is poured during the building of structures such as roads and highway overpasses
in the uk the skill of making timber formwork for poured or in situ concrete is referred to as shuttering
carpentry in the united states is historically defined similarly to the united kingdom as the heavier and stronger  work distinguished from a joiner who does lighter and more ornamental work than that of a carpenter although the work of a carpenter and joiner are often combined  joiner is less common than the terms finish carpenter or cabinetmaker
the terms housewright and barn right were used historically now occasionally used by carpenters who work using traditional methods and materials
someone who builds custom concrete formwork is a form carpenter
wood is one of mankinds oldest building materials
the ability to shape wood improved with technological advances from the stone age to the bronze age to the iron age
some of the oldest archaeological evidence of carpentry are water well casings
these include an oak and hazel structure dating from  bc found in ostrov czech republic and one built using split oak timbers with mortise and tenon and notched corners excavated in eastern germany dating from about  years ago in the early neolithic period
relatively little information about carpentry is available from prehistory before written language or even recent centuries because the knowledge and skills were passed down person to person rarely in writing until the printing press was invented in the th century and builders began regularly publishing guides and pattern books in the th and th centuries
the oldest surviving complete architectural text is vitruvius ten books collectively titled de architectura which discuss some carpentry
some of the oldest surviving wooden buildings in the world are temples in china such as the nanchan temple builtin  the greensted church parts of which are from the th century and the stave churches in norway from the th and th centuries
by the th century sawmills were coming into use in europe
the founding of america was partly based on a desire to extract resources from the new continent including wood for use in ships and buildings in europe
in the th century part of the industrial revolution was the invention of the steam engine and cut nails
these technologies combined with the invention of the circular saw led to the development of balloon framing which was the beginning of the decline of traditional timber framingthe th century saw the development of electrical engineering and distribution which allowed the development of handheld power tools wire nails and machines to massproduce screws
in the th century portland cement came into common use and concrete foundations allowed carpenters to do away with heavy timber sills
also drywall plasterboard came into common use replacing lime plaster on wooden lath
plywood engineered lumber and chemically treated lumber also came into use
for types of carpentry used in america see american historic carpentry
carpentry requires training which involves both acquiring knowledge and physical practice
in formal training a carpenter begins as an apprentice then becomes a journeyman and with enough experience and competency can eventually attain the status of a master carpenter
today preapprenticeship training may be gained through nonunion vocational programs such as high school shop classes and community colleges
informally a laborer may simply work alongside carpenters for years learning skills by observation and peripheral assistance
while such an individual may obtain journeyman status by paying the union entry fee and obtaining a journeymans card which provides the right to work on a union carpentry crew the carpenter foreman will by necessity dismiss any worker who presents the card but does not demonstrate the expected skill level
carpenters may work for an employer or be selfemployed
no matter what kind of training a carpenter has had some us states require contractors to be licensed which requires passing a written test and having minimum levels of insurance
formal training in the carpentry trade is available in seminars certificate programs highschool programs online classes in the new construction restoration and preservation carpentry fields
sometimes these programs are called preapprenticeship training
in the modern british construction industry carpenters are trained through apprenticeship schemes where general certificates of secondary education gcse in mathematics english and technology help but are not essential
however this is deemed the preferred route as young people can earn and gain field experience whilst training towards a nationally recognized qualification
there are two main divisions of training constructioncarpentry and cabinetmaking
during preapprenticeship trainees in each of these divisions spend  hours a week for  weeks in classrooms and indoor workshops learning mathematics trade terminology and skill in the use of hand and power tools
constructioncarpentry trainees also participate in calisthenics to prepare for the physical aspect of the work
upon completion of preapprenticeship trainees who have successfully passed the graded curriculum taught by highly experienced journeyman carpenters are assigned to a local union and to union carpentry crews at work on construction sites or in cabinet shops as first year apprentices
over the next four years as they progress in status to second year third year and fourth year apprentice apprentices periodically return to the training facility every three months for a week of more detailed training in specific aspects of the trade
tradesmen in countries such as germany and australia are required to fulfill a formal apprenticeship usually three to four years to work as a professional carpenter
upon graduation from the apprenticeship he or she is known as a journeyman carpenter
up through the th and even the early th century the journeyman traveled to another region of the country to learn the building styles and techniques of that area before usually returning home
in modern times journeymen are not required to travel and the term now refers to a level of proficiency and skill
union carpenters in the united states that is members of the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america are required to pass a skills test to be granted official journeyman status but uncertified professional carpenters may also be known as journeymen based on their skill level years of experience or simply because they support themselves in the trade and not due to any certification or formal woodworking education
professional status as a journeyman carpenter in the united states may be obtained in a number of ways
formal training is acquired in a fouryear apprenticeship program administered by the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners of america in which journeyman status is obtained after successful completion of twelve weeks of preapprenticeship training followed by four years of onthejob field training working alongside journeyman carpenters
the timber framers guild also has a formal apprenticeship program for traditional timber framing
training is also available in groups like the kim bồng woodworking village in vietnam where apprentices live and work to learn woodworking and carpentry skills
in canada each province sets its own standards for apprenticeship
the average length of time is four years and includes a minimum number of hours of both onthejob training and technical instruction at a college or other institution
depending on the number of hours of instruction an apprentice receives he or she can earn a certificate of proficiency making him or her a journeyman or a certificate of qualification which allows him or her to practice a more limited amount of carpentry
canadian carpenters also have the option of acquiring an additional interprovincial red seal that allows them to practice anywhere in canada
the red seal requires the completion of an apprenticeship and an additional examination
after working as a journeyman for a while a carpenter may go on to study or test as a master carpenter
in some countries such as germany iceland and japan this is an arduous and expensive process requiring extensive knowledge including economic and legal knowledge and skill to achieve master certification these countries generally require master status for anyone employing and teaching apprentices in the craft
in others like the united states master carpenter can be a loosely used term to describe any skilled carpenter
fully trained carpenters and joiners will often move into related trades such as shop fitting scaffolding bench joinery maintenance and system installation
carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood which has been prepared by splitting riving hewing or sawing with a pit saw or sawmill called lumber american english or timber british english
today natural and engineered lumber and many other building materials carpenters may use are typically prepared by others and delivered to the job site
in  the carpenters union in america used the term carpenter for a catchall position
tasks performed by union carpenters include installing flooring windows doors interior trim cabinetry solid surface roofing framing siding flooring insulation acoustical ceilings computeraccess flooring metal framing wall partitions office furniture systems and both custom or factoryproduced materials trim and molding ceiling treatments exposed columns and beams displays mantels staircasesmetal studs metal lath and drywall
carpentry is often hazardous work
types of woodworking and carpentry hazards include machine hazards flying materials tool projection fire and explosion electrocution noise vibration dust and chemicals
in the united states the occupational safety and health administration osha tries to prevent illness injury and fire through regulations
however selfemployed workers are not covered by the osha act
osha claims that since  workplace fatalities have been reduced by more than  percent and occupational injury and illness rates have declined by  percent
at the same time us employment has almost doubled
the leading cause of overall fatalities called the fatal four are falls followed by struck by object electrocution and caughtinbetween
in general construction employers must provide working conditions that are free of known dangers
keep floors in work areas in a clean and so far as possible dry condition
select and provide required personal protective equipment at no cost to workers
train workers about job hazards in a language that they can understand
examples of how to prevent falls includes placing railings and toeboards at any floor opening which can not be well covered and elevated platforms and safety harness and lines safety nets stair railings and handrails
safety is not just about the workers on the job site
carpenters work needs to meet the requirements in the life safety code such as in stair building and building codes to promote longterm quality and safety for the building occupants
construction is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects systems or organizations and comes from latin constructio from com together and struere to pile up and old french construction
to construct is the verb the act of building and the noun is construction how something is built the nature of its structure
in its most widely used context construction covers the processes involved in delivering buildings infrastructure and industrial facilities and associated activities through to the end of their life
it typically starts with planning financing and design and continues until the asset is built and ready for use construction also covers repairs and maintenance work any works to expand extend and improve the asset and its eventual demolition dismantling or decommissioning
as an industry construction accounts for more than  of global gdp  in developed countries and employs around  of the global workforce over m people
the output of the global construction industry was worth an estimated  trillion in 
the first huts and shelters were constructed by hand or with simple tools
as cities grew during the bronze age a class of professional craftsmen like bricklayers and carpenters appeared
occasionally slaves were used for construction work
in the middle ages the artisan craftsmen were organized into guilds
in the th century steampowered machinery appeared and later diesel and electricpowered vehicles such as cranes excavators and bulldozers
fasttrack construction has been increasingly popular in the st century
some estimates suggest that  of construction projects are now fasttrack construction
broadly there are three sectors of construction buildings infrastructure and industrial
the industry can also be classified into sectors or markets
for example engineering newsrecord enr a usbased construction trade magazine has compiled and reported data about the size of design and construction contractors
in  it split the data into nine market segments transportation petroleum buildings power industrial water manufacturing sewerwaste telecom hazardous waste and a tenth category for other projects
enr used data on transportation sewer hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors
the standard industrial classification and the newer north american industry classification system classify companies that perform or engage in construction into three subsectors building construction heavy and civil engineering construction and specialty trade contractors
there are also categories for professional services firms eg engineering architecture surveying project management
building construction is the process of adding structures to areas of land also known as real property sites
typically a project is instigated by or with the owner of the property who may be an individual or an organisation occasionally land may be compulsorily purchased from the owner for public use
residential construction may be undertaken by individual landowners selfbuild by specialist housebuilders by property developers by general contractors or by providers of public or social housing eg local authorities housing associations
where local zoning or planning policies allow mixeduse developments may comprise both residential and nonresidential construction eg retail leisure offices public buildings etc
residential construction practices technologies and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice
materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used eg brick versus stone versus timber
costs of construction on a per square meter or per square foot basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions access routes local regulations economies of scale customdesigned homes are often more expensive to build and the availability of skilled tradespeople
depending upon the type of building nonresidential building construction can be procured by a wide range of private and public organisations including local authorities educational and religious bodies transport undertakings retailers hoteliers property developers financial institutions and other private companies
most construction in these sectors is undertaken by general contractors
civil engineering covers the design construction and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment including public works such as roads bridges canals dams tunnels airports water and sewerage systems pipelines and railways
some general contractors have expertise in civil engineering civil engineering contractors are firms dedicated to work in this sector and may specialise in particular types of infrastructure
industrial construction includes offshore construction mainly of energy installations oil and gas platforms wind power mining and quarrying refineries breweries distilleries and other processing plants power stations steel mills warehouses and factories
some construction projects are small renovations or repair jobs where the owner may act as designer paymaster and laborer for the entire project
however more complex or ambitious projects usually require additional multidisciplinary expertise and manpower so the owner may commission one or more specialist businesses to undertake detailed planning design construction and handover of the work
often the owner will appoint one business to oversee the project this may be a designer a contractor a construction manager or other advisor such specialists are normally appointed for their expertise in project delivery and will help the owner define the project brief agree a budget and schedule liaise with relevant public authorities and procure the services of other specialists the supply chain comprising subcontractors
contracts are agreed for the delivery of services by all businesses alongside other detailed plans aimed at ensuring legal timely onbudget and safe delivery of the specified works
design finance and legal aspects overlap and interrelate
the design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location but must also be financially possible to build and legal to use
the financial structure must be adequate to build the design provided and must pay amounts that are legally owed
legal structures integrate design with other activities and enforce financial and other construction processes
these processes also affect procurement strategies
clients may for example appoint a business to design the project after which a competitive process is undertaken to appoint a lead contractor to construct the asset design bid build they may appoint a business to lead both design and construction designbuild or they may directly appoint a designer contractor and specialist subcontractors construction management
some forms of procurement emphasise collaborative relationships partnering alliancing between the client the contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project seeking to ameliorate often highly competitive and adversarial industry practices
when applicable a proposed construction project must comply with local landuse planning policies including zoning and building code requirements
a project will normally be assessed by the authority having jurisdiction ahj typically the municipality where the project will be located for its potential impacts on neighbouring properties and upon existing infrastructure transportation social infrastructure and utilities including water supply sewerage electricity telecommunications etc
data may be gathered through site analysis site surveys and geotechnical investigations
construction normally can not start until planning permission has been granted and may require preparatory work to ensure relevant infrastructure has been upgraded before building work can commence
preparatory works will also include surveys of existing utility lines to avoid damage causing outages and other hazardous situations
some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations or the desire to prevent indisputably bad phenomena eg
explosions or bridge collapses
other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations or factors that are a matter of custom or expectation such as isolating businesses from a business district or residences from a residential district
an attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable the bridge design will not cause a collapse or that the custom is no longer needed acceptance of livework spaces has grown in the community
during construction of a building a municipal building inspector usually inspects the ongoing work periodically to ensure that construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code
once construction is complete any later changes made to a building or other asset that affect safety including its use expansion structural integrity and fire protection usually require municipality approval
depending on the type of project mortgage bankers accountants and cost engineers may participe in creating an overall plan for the financial management of a construction project
the presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely even in relatively small projects since the owners equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project
accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process
professionals including cost engineers estimators and quantity surveyors apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation
financial planning ensures adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and ensures that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project
construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems
underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project
cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding can not cover the current costs for labour and materials such problems may arise even when the overall budget is adequate presenting a temporary issue
cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid
fraud is also an occasional construction issue
large projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with a conceptual estimate performed by a building estimator
as portions of a project are completed they may be sold supplanting one lender or owner for another while the logistical requirements of having the right trades and materials available for each stage of the building construction project carries forward
public private partnerships ppps or private finance initiatives pfis may also be used to help delivery major projects
according to mckinsey in  the vast majority of large construction projects go over budget and take  longer than expected
a construction project is a complex net of construction contracts and other legal obligations each of which all parties must carefully consider
a contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties and provides structures to manage issues
for example construction delays can be costly so construction contracts set out clear expectations and clear paths to manage delays
poorly drafted contracts can lead to confusion and costly disputes
at the start of a project legal advisors seek to identify ambiguities and other potential sources of trouble in the contract structures and to present options for preventing problems
during projects they work to avoid and resolve conflicts that arise
in each case the lawyer facilitates an exchange of obligations that matches the reality of the project
designbidbuild is the most common and wellestablished method of construction procurement
in this arrangement the architect engineer or builder acts for the client as the project coordinator
they design the works prepare specifications and design deliverables models drawings etc administer the contract tender the works and manage the works from inception to completion
in parallel there are direct contractual links between the client and the main contractor who in turn has direct contractual relationships with subcontractors
the arrangement continues until the project is ready for handover
designbuild became more common from the late th century and involves the client contracting a single entity to provide design and construction
in some cases the designbuild package can also include finding the site arranging funding and applying for all necessary statutory consents
typically the client invites several db contractors to submit proposals to meet the project brief and then selects a preferred supplier
often this will be a consortium involving a design firm and a contractor sometimes more than one of each
in the united states departments of transportation usually use designbuild contracts as a way of progressing projects where states lack the skills or resources particularly for very large projects
in a construction management arrangement the client enters into separate contracts with the designer architect or engineer a construction manager and individual trade contractors
the client takes on the contractual role while the construction or project manager provides the active role of managing the separate trade contracts and ensuring that they complete all work smoothly and effectively together
this approach is often used to speed up procurement processes to allow the client greater flexibility in design variation throughout the contract to enable the appointment of individual work contractors to separate contractual responsibility on each individual throughout the contract and to provide greater client control
in the industrialized world construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality
most commonly ie in a designbidbuild project the design team is employed by ie
in contract with the property owner
depending upon the type of project a design team may include architects civil engineers mechanical engineers electrical engineers structural engineers fire protection engineers planning consultants architectural consultants and archaeological consultants
a lead designer will normally be identified to help coordinate different disciplinary inputs to the overall design
this may be aided by integration of previously separate disciplines often undertaken by separate firms into multidisciplinary firms with experts from all related fields or by firms establishing relationships to support designbuild processes
the increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design professionals trained in all phases of a projects lifecycle and develop an appreciation of the asset as an advanced technological system requiring close integration of many subsystems and their individual components including sustainability
for buildings building engineering is an emerging discipline that attempts to meet this new challenge
traditionally design has involved the production of sketches architectural and engineering drawings and specifications
until the late th century drawings were largely handdrafted adoption of computeraided design cad technologies then improved design productivity while the st century introduction of building information modeling bim processes has involved use of computergenerated models that can be used in their own right or to generate drawings and other visualisations as well as capturing nongeometric data about building components and systems
on some projects work on site will not start until design work is largely complete on others some design work may be undertaken concurrently with the early stages of onsite activity for example work on a buildings foundations may commence while designers are still working on the detailed designs of the buildings internal spaces
some projects may include elements that are designed for offsite construction see also prefabrication and modular building and are then delivered to site ready for erection installation or assembly
once contractors and other relevant professionals have been appointed and designs are sufficiently advanced work may commence on the project site
typically a construction site will include a secure perimeter to restrict unauthorised access site access control points office and welfare accommodation for personnel from the main contractor and other firms involved in the project team and storage areas for materials machinery and equipment
according to the mcgrawhill dictionary of architecture and constructions definition construction may be said to have started when the first feature of the permanent structure has been put in place such as pile driving or the pouring of slabs or footings
commissioning is the process of verifying that all subsystems of a new building or other asset work as intended to achieve the owners project requirements and as designed by the projects architects and engineers
maintenance involves functional checks servicing repairing or replacing of necessary devices equipment machinery building infrastructure and supporting utilities in industrial business governmental and residential installations
demolition is the discipline of safely and efficiently tearing down buildings and other artificial structures
demolition contrasts with deconstruction which involves taking a building apart while carefully preserving valuable elements for reuse purposes recycling see also circular economy
the output of the global construction industry was worth an estimated  trillion in  and in  was forecast to rise to  trillion by 
as a sector construction accounts for more than  of global gdp in developed countries construction comprises  of gdp and employs around  of the total employed workforce around the globe accounting for over  million full and parttime jobs in 
since  china has been the worlds largest single construction market
the united states is the second largest construction market with a  output of  trillion
in the united states in february  around  trillion worth of construction work was in progress according to the census bureau of which just over  trillion was for the private sector split roughly  between residential and nonresidential the remainder was public sector predominantly for state and local government
construction is a major source of employment in most countries high reliance on small businesses and underrepresentation of women are common traits
for example
according to mckinsey research productivity growth per worker in construction has lagged behind many other industries across different countries including in the united states and in european countries
in the united states construction productivity per worker has declined by half since the s
the twentyfive largest countries in the world by construction gva 
largescale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines
a project manager normally manages the budget on the job and a construction manager design engineer construction engineer or architect supervises it
those involved with the design and execution must consider zoning requirements and legal issues environmental impact of the project scheduling budgeting and bidding construction site safety availability and transportation of building materials logistics and inconvenience to the public including those caused by construction delays
there are many routes to the different careers within the construction industry
there are three main tiers based on educational background and training which vary by country
unskilled and semiskilled workers provide general site labor often have few or no construction qualifications and may receive basic site training
skilled tradespeople have typically served apprenticeships sometimes in labor unions or received technical training this group also includes onsite managers who possess extensive knowledge and experience in their craft or profession
skilled manual occupations include carpenters electricians plumbers ironworkers heavy equipment operators and masons as well as those involved in project management
in the uk these require further education qualifications often in vocational subject areas undertaken either directly after completing compulsory education or through on the job apprenticeships
professional technical and managerial personnel often have higher education qualifications usually graduate degrees and are trained to design and manage construction processes
these roles require more training as they demand greater technical knowledge and involve more legal responsibility
example roles and qualification routes include
construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the united states and in the european union
in the us in or about  of worker fatalities in private industry occurred in construction
in  more than a third of us construction fatalities  out of  total fatalities were the result of falls
proper safety equipment such as harnesses hard hats and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry
other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution transportation accidents and trench caveins
other safety risks for workers in construction include hearing loss due to high noise exposure musculoskeletal injury chemical exposure and high levels of stress
besides that the high turnover of workers in construction industry imposes a huge challenge of accomplishing the restructuring of work practices in individual workplaces or with individual workers
citation needed construction has been identified by the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh as a priority industry sector in the national occupational research agenda nora to identify and provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health and safety issues
sustainability during the construction phase is an aspect of green building defined by the united states environmental protection agency epa as the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resourceefficient throughout a buildings lifecycle from siting to design construction operation maintenance renovation and deconstruction
a construction worker is a worker employed in manual labour of the physical construction of the built environment and its infrastructurethe term is a broad generic one and most such workers are primarily described by the specific level and type of work they perform
for example laborers carry out a wide range of practical tasks to help tradespersons on construction sites
they clean the construction site on a regular basis using tools such as rakes shovels and wheelbarrows to remove rubble scraps of metal and wood
they might also need to sweep out certain areas and put building supplies in order
construction workers may colloquially be referred to as hard hat workers or hard hats as they often wear hard hats for safety
construction safety is intended to ensure a safe environment for workers who are required to be educated on safety at each site
in a human rights watch report described unsafe and unfair working conditions in china and a failure on the part of the government to enforce labor standards in the construction industry
the international labour organization ilo estimated that at the end of   of the  million construction workers in china were migrant workers
many turned to work after their farming communities collapsed into povertyin the united states illegal immigrant labor is prevalent in the industry
due to workers questionable legal status some employers commit crimes such as wage theft and violation of workplace standards running little risk of consequences
similar abuse occurred in qatar during preparations for the  fifa world cup where workers mostly from poor countries in the indian subcontinent work in desert conditions for as little as  a day
allocation of costs is the transfer of costs from one cost item to one or more other cost items

rsmeans publishes a city cost index table
construction is a process that consists of the creation modification or demolition of facilities buildings civil and monumental works and infrastructure
construction cost the total cost to construct a project
this value usually does not include the preplanning site or right of way acquisition or design costs and may not include startup and commissioning costs
this total or subtotal is usually identified as such in an estimate report
also known as total estimated contract cost tecc
consumables are goods that according to the  edition of websters dictionary are capable of being consumed that may be destroyed dissipated wasted or spent also known as consumable goods nondurable goods or soft goods
in construction these may include such materials as weld rod fasteners tape glue etc
contingency when estimating the cost for a project product or other item or investment there is always uncertainty as to the precise content of all items in the estimate how work will be performed what work conditions will be like when the project is executed and so on
these uncertainties are risks to the project
some refer to these risks as knownunknowns because the estimator is aware of them and based on past experience can even estimate their probable costs
the estimated costs of the knownunknowns is referred to by cost estimators as cost contingency
cost the value of currency required to obtain a product or service to expend labor and use equipment and tools or to operate a business
cost index or factor a value used to adjust the cost of from one time to another
there are various published cost indexes listed by year quarter or month
rsmeans publishes a historical cost index
costing the process of applying appropriate costs to the line items after the take off
rsmeans refers to this as price the quantities
may also be called pricing

indirect costs are costs that are not directly accountable to a cost object such as a particular project facility function or product
see also overhead general administrative cost distributable
labor a category of cost which is incurred to employ people workers crafts trades etc
in the execution of construction work activity
labor benefits are additional costs such as holiday pay or health insurance which the employer pays directly to the employee or into a fund on behalf of the employee
labor burden is the cost of payroll taxes and insurances such as workers compensation which the employer must pay to employ workers
labor rate sometimes price the amount of currency per unit of time which is required to employ people workers crafts trades etc
in the execution of construction work activity
the rate may represent the wage rate only or may include various benefits and labor burdens
line item one element of cost in an estimate which is listed in the estimate spreadsheet
location cost index or factor the ratio of the cost in one location to that in another location
these may include or exclude currency exchange rates

manhour norms a set of standard manhour rates for work tasks given normal working conditions
manhour rate the amount of manhours which are consumed executing one unit of work activity
manhour rate manhours required for work completed work quantity
example excavation  mhcy
the manhour rate is related to the inverse of the production rate times the number of workers in the crew performing the work
example excavation at  cyday  hour day with man crew  x    manhourscy

home construction is the process of constructing a house generally referred to as a home when giving consideration to the people who might now or someday reside there
beginning with simple prehistoric shelters home construction techniques have evolved to produce the vast multitude of living accommodations available today
different levels of wealth and power have warranted various sizes luxuries and even defenses in a home
environmental considerations and cultural influences have created an immensely diverse collection of architectural styles
from castles to mud thatches mansions to shanties the home has grown to represent a seemingly limitless array of structures
the modern realty trade conventionally gives preference to home as a warmer term in reference to the house structure in the speculative context terminology reverts to house as a unit of built residential property as in the board game monopoly
note that a duplex is a housing structure which consists of two separate homes a duplex amounts to a single building construction project later marketed independently as two separate homes

and an international proliferation of kitset home and prefabricated home suppliers often consisting of components of chinese origin has further increased supply and made diy home building more prevalent
the process often starts with a planning stage in which plans are prepared by an architect and approved by the client and any regulatory authority
then the site is cleared foundations are laid and trenches for connection to services such as sewerage water and electricity are established
if the house is woodenframed a framework is constructed to support the boards siding and roof
if the house is of brick construction then courses of bricks are laid to construct the walls
floors beams and internal walls are constructed as the building develops with plumbing and wiring for water and electricity being installed as appropriate
once the main structure is complete internal fitting with lights and other fitments is done decorate home and furnished with furniture cupboards carpets curtains and other fittings

if a location is not on the nearby places list the user can add the location directly from the phone
once users have checked in they have the option of sharing their location with friends in services such as twitter or facebook
since the checkin became a ubiquitous mechanism in most mobile applications the industry especially in the gaming branch has tried to find alternatives
clarification needed gaming applications in particular require the user to check in multiple times in a row so the mechanism becomes a sustained routine

modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the grand tour which was a traditional trip around europe especially germany and italy undertaken by mainly upperclass european young men of means mainly from western and northern european countries
in the young prince of poland ladislaus sigismund vasa the eldest son of sigismund iii embarked on a journey across europe as was in custom among polish nobility
he travelled through territories of todays germany belgium the netherlands where he admired the siege of breda by spanish forces france switzerland to italy austria and the czech republic
it was an educational journey and one of the outcomes was introduction of italian opera in the polish lithuanian commonwealth
the custom flourished from about  until the advent of largescale rail transit in the s and generally followed a standard itinerary
it was an educational opportunity and rite of passage
though primarily associated with the british nobility and wealthy landed gentry similar trips were made by wealthy young men of protestant northern european nations on the continent and from the second half of the th century some south american us and other overseas youth joined in
the tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier and thomas cook made the cooks tour a byword

in this period johann joachim winckelmanns theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the european academic world
artists writers and travellers such as goethe affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which italy france and greece provide excellent examples

cox kings was the first official travel company to be formed in 
the british origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names
in nice france one of the first and bestestablished holiday resorts on the french riviera the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the promenade des anglais in many other historic resorts in continental europe old wellestablished palace hotels have names like the hotel bristol hotel carlton or hotel majestic reflecting the dominance of english customers
a pioneer of the travel agency business thomas cooks idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the london road at kibworth
with the opening of the extended midland counties railway he arranged to take a group of  temperance campaigners from leicester campbell street station to a rally in loughborough eleven miles  km away
on july  thomas cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person this included rail tickets and food for the journey
cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers as the railway tickets being legal contracts between company and passenger could not have been issued at his own price
clarification needed this was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous unadvertised private excursion trains
during the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and sunday school children
in  the midland counties railway company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him provided he found the passengers
this success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure taking a percentage of the railway fares
in he planned his first excursion abroad when he took a group from leicester to calais to coincide with the paris exhibition
the following year he started his grand circular tours of europe
during the s he took parties to switzerland italy egypt and the united states
cook established inclusive independent travel whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route
such was his success that the scottish railway companies withdrew their support between  and  to try the excursion business for themselves
the tourism industry as part of the service sector has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries
the manila declaration on world tourism of  recognized its importance as an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social cultural educational and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations
tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists accounting as of update for  of the worlds trade in services and as an invisible export for  of overall exports of goods and services
it also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism

this is in addition to goods bought by tourists including souvenirs
on the flipside tourism can degrade people
and sour relationships between host and guest
the economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets the cultural property and the nature of the travel location
the world heritage sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets
but even a countrys current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism
for example the fascination of the british royal family brings millions of tourists to great britain every year and thus the economy around  million a year
the habsburg family can be mentioned in central europe
according to estimates the habsburg brand should generate tourism sales of  million euros per year for vienna alone
the tourist principle habsburg sells applies
cultural and natural heritage are in many cases the absolute basis for worldwide tourism
cultural tourism is one of the megatrends that is reflected in massive numbers of overnight stays and sales
as unesco is increasingly observing the cultural heritage is needed for tourism but also endangered by it
the icomos international cultural tourism charter from  is already dealing with all of these problems
as a result of the tourist hazard for example the lascaux cave was rebuilt for tourists
overtourism is an important buzzword in this area
furthermore the focus of unesco in war zones is to ensure the protection of cultural heritage in order to maintain this future important economic basis for the local population
and there is intensive cooperation between unesco the united nations the united nations peacekeeping and blue shield international
there are extensive international and national considerations studies and programs to protect cultural assets from the effects of tourism and those from war
in particular it is also about training civilian and military personnel
but the involvement of the locals is particularly important
the founding president of blue shield international karl von habsburg summed it up with the words without the local community and without the local participants that would be completely impossible
cruising is a popular form of water tourism
leisure cruise ships were introduced by the peninsular oriental steam navigation company po in  sailing from southampton to destinations such as gibraltar malta and athens

by the s over  tourists per year used thomas cook son
the relationship between tourism companies transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism
cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads
one contemporary form of mass tourism package tourism still incorporates the partnership between these three groups
travel developed during the early th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes
improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time
in continental europe early seaside resorts included heiligendamm founded in  at the baltic sea being the first seaside resort ostend popularised by the people of brussels boulognesurmer and deauville for the parisians taormina in sicily

st moritz switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the s hotel manager johannes badrutt invited some summer guests from england to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape thereby inaugurating a popular trend
it was however only in the s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the swiss ski resorts
even in winter up to one third of all guests depending on the location consist of nonskiers
major ski resorts are located mostly in the various european countries eg
andorra austria bulgaria bosniaherzegovina croatia czech republic cyprus finland france germany greece iceland italy norway latvia lithuania poland romania serbia sweden slovakia slovenia spain switzerland turkey canada the united states eg
montana utah colorado california wyoming vermont new hampshire new york argentina new zealand japan south korea chile and lebanon
there has been an uptrend in tourism over the last few decadesvague especially in europe where international travel for short breaks is common
tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them
for example some people prefer simple beach vacations while others want more specialized holidays quieter resorts familyoriented holidays or niche markettargeted destination hotels
the developments in air transport infrastructure such as jumbo jets lowcost airlines and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable
a major factor in the relatively low cost of air travel is the tax exemption for aviation fuels
the who estimated in  that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time
there have also been changes in lifestyle for example some retirementage people sustain yearround tourism
this is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services
some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailormade package requested by the customer upon impulse
there have been a few setbacks in tourism such as the september  attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as in bali and several european cities
also on  december  a tsunami caused by the  indian ocean earthquake hit the asian countries on the indian ocean including the maldives
thousands of lives were lost including many tourists
this together with the vast cleanup operations stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time
individual lowprice or even zeroprice overnight stays have become more popular in the s especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like couchsurfing and airbnb being established
there has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of gdp is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism as has occurred for instance in dubai
sustainable tourism is a concept that covers the complete tourism experience including concern for economic social and environmental issues as well as attention to improving tourists experiences and addressing the needs of host communities
sustainable tourism emerged as an outcome of preventing the uncontrolled and excessive use of mountain tourism resources and attractions in sumadija and western serbia

volunteer tourism or voluntourism is growing as a largely western phenomenon with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities
wearing  defines volunteer tourism as applying to those tourists who for various reasons volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society
vso was founded in the uk in  and the us peace corps was subsequently founded in 
these were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism
this form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism
however increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour and force unwilling host communities to adopt western initiatives while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist
increasingly organisations such as vso have been concerned with communitycentric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people
propoor tourism which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development the issue has been addressed through smallscale projects in local communities and through attempts by ministries of tourism to attract large numbers of tourists
research by the overseas development institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists money to reach the poorest as only  or less far less in some cases ever reaches the poor successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountainclimbing in tanzania and cultural tourism in luang prabang laos
there is also the possibility of propoor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world
recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis
recession tourism is defined by lowcost and highvalue experiences taking place at oncepopular generic retreats
various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travellers are elongating trips where their money travels further
this concept is not widely used in tourism research
it is related to the shortlived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation

educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of the classroom environment
brent w ritchie publisher of managing educational tourism created a study of a geographic subdivision to demonstrate how tourism educated high school students participating in foreign exchange programs over the last  years
in educational tourism the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture study tours or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment such as in the international practicum training program
in  one impact was many exchange students traveled to america to assist students financially in order to maintain their secondary education
this type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the cityregion
this type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience
creating a sustainable atmosphere creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices
an example of event tourism would be the music festival south by southwest that is hosted in austin texas annually
every year people from all over the world flock to the city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see bands perform
people are drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which defines event tourism
creative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism since the early beginnings of tourism itself
its european roots date back to the time of the grand tour which saw the sons of aristocratic families travelling for the purpose of mostly interactive educational experiences
more recently creative tourism has been given its own name by crispin raymond and greg richards who as members of the association for tourism and leisure education atlas have directed a number of projects for the european commission including cultural and crafts tourism known as sustainable tourism
they have defined creative tourism as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences
meanwhile the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by highprofile organizations such as unesco who through the creative cities network have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place
unesco wrote in one of its documents creative tourism involves more interaction in which the visitor has an educational emotional social and participative interaction with the place its living culture and the people who live there
they feel like a citizen
saying so the tourist will have the opportunity to take part in workshops classes and activities related to the culture of the destination
more recently creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism drawing on active participation by travellers in the culture of the host communities they visit
several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development including the united kingdom austria france the bahamas jamaica spain italy new zealand and south korea
the growing interest of tourists in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism highlighting the intangible heritage craft workshops cooking classes etc
and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure for example through the rent of halls and auditoriums
experiential travel or immersion travel is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry
it is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country city or particular place by connecting to its history people food and culture

one emerging area of special interest has been identified by lennon and foley  as dark tourism
this type of tourism involves visits to dark sites such as battlegrounds scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide for example concentration camps
its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs
philip stone argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining ones own death through the real death of others
erik h cohen introduces the term populo sites to evidence the educational character of dark tourism
popular sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors
based on a study at yad vashem the shoah holocaust memorial museum in jerusalem a new term in populo is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell
learning about the shoah in jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in europe but equally authentic
it is argued that a dichotomy between authentic sites at the location of a tragedy and created sites elsewhere is insufficient
participants evaluations of seminars for european teachers at yad vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject
implications for other cases of dark tourism at in populo locations are discussed
in this vein peter tarlow defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths which continue to impact our lives
this issue can not be understood without the figure of trauma
victoria mitchell et al
suggest that dark tourism seems to be a heterogeneous discipline
there is a great dispersion of definitions knowledge production and meanings revolving around the term
in fact dark tourism practices vary in culture and time
qualitative speaking dark tourism experience is pretty different from leisure practices
to fill the gap the existent definitions should be catalogued in subcategories to form an allencompassing model that expands the current understanding of dark tourism
 in consonance with this m apleni et al
argue dark tourism helps the industry not to be fragmented before the ongoing states of crises the activity often faces
they cite the case of terrorism which paves the way for the construction of a new dark site
dark tourism plays a leading role not only in enhancing destination resilience but also in helping communities to deal with traumatic experiences
social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation
it includes youth hostels and lowpriced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations trade unions or in communist times publicly owned enterprises
in may  at the second congress of social tourism in austria walter hunziker proposed the following definition social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by lowincome groups and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services
also known as tourism of doom or last chance tourism this emerging trend involves travelling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened such as the ice caps of mount kilimanjaro the melting glaciers of patagonia or the coral of the great barrier reef before it is too late
identified by travel trade magazine travel age west editorinchief kenneth shapiro in  and later explored in the new york times this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise
some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming overpopulation or climate change
others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individuals carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing
religious tourism in particular pilgrimage can serve to strengthen faith and to demonstrate devotion both of which are central tenets of many major religions
need quotation to verify religious tourists may seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their selfidentity in a positive manner
given this the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious selfidentity or not
dna tourism also called ancestry tourism or heritage travel is tourism based on dna testing
these tourists visit their remote relatives or places where their ancestors came from or where their relatives reside based on the results of dna tests
dna testing became a growing trend in 
tourism brings both positive and negative impacts on tourist destinations
the traditionallydescribed domains of tourism impacts are economic sociocultural and environmental dimensions
the economic effects of tourism include improved tax revenue and personal income increased standards of living and more employment opportunities
sociocultural impacts are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds attitudes and behaviors and relationships to material goods
environmental impacts can have both direct effects including degradation of habitat vegetation air quality bodies of water the water table wildlife and changes in natural phenomena and indirect effects such as increased harvesting of natural resources to supply food indirect air and water pollution including from flights transport and the manufacture of food and souvenirs for tourists
excessive hordes of visitors or of the wrong sort of visitors can provoke backlashes from otherwise friendly hosts in popular destinations
negative environmental consequences related to tourism activities such as greenhouse gas emissions from air travel and litter at popular locations can be significant
tourism is sometimes associated with export or theft of contraband such as endangered species or certain cultural artifacts and illegal sex trade activities
in recent yearswhen
the local population in many areas has developed antitourism sentiment and begun to protest against tourists
one of the most prominent examples of such a mobilization was the socalled tourists go home movement which emerged in  in spain due to slogans and mottos calling the tourists to go back to their homes
venice also faced such problems and the tourists go home slogans appeared on the walls of the city
moreover several other countries such as japan and the philippines are having problems with overtourism
the year seems to be a landmark for antitourism sentiment as a new spanish social movement against an economic development model based on mass tourism gained following highprofile attacks targeting foreign tourists and local business interests
antitourism sentiment also seems to be linked to a clash of identity and peoples individualism
the world tourism organization unwto forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 
with the advent of ecommerce tourism products have become prominent traded items on the internet
tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries although tourism providers hotels airlines etc
including smallscale operators can sell their services directly
this has put pressure on intermediaries from both online and traditional shops
it has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context
not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies
this is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future
there has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism with only the russian space agency providing transport to date
a report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billiondollar market by 
since the late s sports tourism has become increasingly popular
events such as rugby olympics commonwealth games and fifa world cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights hotels and excursions
tourism security is a subdiscipline of tourist studies that explores the factors that affect the ontological security of tourists
risks are evaluated by their impact and nature
tourism security includes methodologies theories and techniques oriented to protect the organic image of tourist destinations
three academic waves are significant in tourism security risk perception theory disaster management and postdisaster consumption
andrew spencer peter tarlow argue that tourism security is not an easy concept to define
it includes a set of subdisciplines and global risks different in nature which cause different effects in the tourism industry
the rise of tourism security and safety as a consolidated discipline coincides with the globalization and ultimate maturation of the industry worldwide
some threats include for example terrorist groups looking to destabilize governments affecting not only the local economies but killing foreign tourists to cause geopolitical tensions between deliverycountry and receivingtourist countries
today island destinations are more affected by terrorism and other global risks than other continent destinations  
as a result of the lates recession international arrivals experienced a strong slowdown beginning in june 
growth from  to  was only  during the first eight months of

while this is considerably milder than what occurred after the  attacks the decline was at twice the rate as real gdp has fallen
in the covid pandemic lockdowns travel bans and a substantial reduction in passenger travel by air and sea contributed to a sharp decline in tourism activity
however evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term

a receptionist may ask visitors who they are to meet and may ask them to sign a register
the receptionist may give a visitor instructions as to where to go or inform the host that his guest has arrived
the visitor may be issued with a visible visitor s pass often worn around the neck
however research shows that long waiting times at the reception area could lead to loss of customers
covid has lead organisations to wider and faster adoption of technology to streamline the visitor checkin process visitor management systems automate the visitor check in process and reduces office checkin time with preregistering visitors through email effective communication qr code express checkin automate host notifications and efficient visitor management workflows
the checkin process at airports enables passengers to checkin luggage onto a plane and to obtain a boarding pass
when presenting at the checkin counter a passenger will provide evidence of the right to travel such as a ticket visa or electronic means
each airline provides facilities for passengers to checkin their luggage except for their carryon bags
this may be by way of airlineemployed staff at checkin counters at airports or through an agency arrangement or by way of a selfservice kiosk
the luggage is weighed and tagged and then placed on a conveyor that usually feeds the luggage into the main baggage handling system
the luggage goes into the aircrafts cargo hold
the checkin staff then issues each passenger with a boarding pass
there is an increasing trend towards more streamlined checkingin processes whereby passengers can bypass or reduce the time in queues at the staffed checkin counters
this may involve passengers checking in online before arriving at the airport or using an airlines selfservice checkin kiosks at the airport
some airports have a curbside checkin where passengers can check in their bags to an airline representative before entering the terminal and then proceeding directly to security
many airlines have a deadline for passengers to check in before each flight
this is to allow the airline to offer unclaimed seats to standby passengers to load luggage onto the plane and to finalize documentation for takeoff
the passenger must also take into account the time that may be needed for them to clear the checkin line to pass security and then to walk sometimes also to ride from the checkin area to the boarding area
this may take several hours at some airports or at some times of the year
on international flights additional time would be required for immigration and customs clearance
hotels and similar establishments usually require guests to check in also called registering or signing in which involves the guest providing or confirming personal information including contact information along with a signature
the laws of some countries require guests to provide this information and to sign a register often called a hotel register or guestbook which may be in the form of a registration card and some also require the provision of identification documents such as a passport or drivers licence which the hotel may wish to copy and retain in its records
usually only one guest is required to register per room
sometimes the register may need to be provided to a government agency such as the local police and sometimes with a court warrant or similar authority
the establishment may require guests to provide a credit card or a security deposit as a guarantee to cover potential costs such as the use of room service or a minibar for the duration of the stay and to facilitate a more expedient checkout process at the end of the guests stay
at the end of the checking in process the reception staff will provide guests with a room key
more and more hotels are implementing an online or contactless checkin options
checkin times vary but can range from about  pm to about  pm depending on the establishments rules and regulations
late checkins can be arranged through the hotel as long as the guests book this in advance and arrange all the necessary details
hotels usually specify a checkin time after which they expect guests to check in
if a guest wants to occupy a hotel room before the hotels checkin time some hotels may charge for an additional day or treat it as a previous days stay as compared to occupying the hotel room after the checkin time
most hotels however allow a grace time typically  minutes upon request by a guest without any additional charge if a guest wishes to have access to the room before the checkin time
some hotels also have a latest checkin time often  pm  pm after which they may give a room to someone else if the room has not been prepaid for or the guest does not phone in to indicate their expected time of arrival
some hotels have a deadline for checking in because the reception desk may close for the night
for the most costeffective usage of hotel room occupancy a guest should try to arrive near a hotels checkin time and leave or hand over the hotel room near the hotels checkout time
however doing so may not always be practical because for example a guests flight arrival and departure times or car trips may not align with a hotels checkin and checkout times
many social networking services such as foursquare google facebook jiepang vk and getglue as well as gowalla closed google latitude closed and brightkite closed in the past allow users to what has been referred to as selfreported positioning or more commonly known as a checkin to a physical place and share their locations with their friends
users can check in to a specific location by text messaging or by using a mobile application on a smartphone the application will use the phones gps to find the current location
many applications have a places button or tab where a user can see a list of nearby places into which the user can check in
if a location is not on the nearby places list the user can add the location directly from the phone
once users have checked in they have the option of sharing their location with friends in services such as twitter or facebook
since the checkin became a ubiquitous mechanism in most mobile applications the industry especially in the gaming branch has tried to find alternatives
clarification needed gaming applications in particular require the user to check in multiple times in a row so the mechanism becomes a sustained routine
example needed currently possibilities for an autocheckin are being tested by developers

international tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of  billion tourists globally for the first time in  emerging source markets such as china russia and brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade
global tourism accounts for c  of global greenhousegas emissions
emissions as well as other significant environmental and social impacts are not always beneficial to local communities and their economies
for this reason many tourist development organizations have begun to focus on sustainable tourism in order to mitigate negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism
the united nations world tourism organization emphasized these practices by promoting tourism as part of the sustainable development goals through programs like the international year for sustainable tourism for development in  and programs like tourism for sdgs focusing on how sdg  sdg  and sdg  implicate tourism in creating a sustainable economy

the economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets the cultural property and the nature of the travel location
the world heritage sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets
but even a countrys current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism
for example the fascination of the british royal family brings millions of tourists to great britain every year and thus the economy around  million a year

pausanias wrote his description of greece in the second century ad
in ancient china nobles sometimes made a point of visiting mount tai and on occasion all five sacred mountains
by the middle ages christianity and buddhism and islam had traditions of pilgrimage
chaucers canterbury tales and wu chengens journey to the west remain classics of english and chinese literature
the th to thcentury song dynasty also saw secular travel writers such as su shi th century and fan chengda th century become popular in china
under the ming xu xiake continued the practice
in medieval italy francesco petrarch also wrote an allegorical account of his  ascent of mount ventoux that praised the act of travelling and criticized frigida incuriositas cold lack of curiosity
the burgundian poet michault taillevent fr later composed his own horrified recollections of a  trip through the jura mountains
modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the grand tour which was a traditional trip around europe especially germany and italy undertaken by mainly upperclass european young men of means mainly from western and northern european countries
in  the young prince of poland ladislaus sigismund vasa the eldest son of sigismund iii embarked on a journey across europe as was in custom among polish nobility
he travelled through territories of todays germany belgium the netherlands where he admired the siege of breda by spanish forces france switzerland to italy austria and the czech republic
it was an educational journey and one of the outcomes was introduction of italian opera in the polish lithuanian commonwealth
the custom flourished from about  until the advent of largescale rail transit in the s and generally followed a standard itinerary
it was an educational opportunity and rite of passage
though primarily associated with the british nobility and wealthy landed gentry similar trips were made by wealthy young men of protestant northern european nations on the continent and from the second half of the th century some south american us and other overseas youth joined in
the tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier and thomas cook made the cooks tour a byword
the grand tour became a real status symbol for upperclass students in the th and th centuries
in this period johann joachim winckelmanns theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the european academic world
artists writers and travellers such as goethe affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which italy france and greece provide excellent examples
for these reasons the grand tours main destinations were to those centers where upperclass students could find rare examples of classic art and history
the new york times recently described the grand tour in this way
three hundred years ago wealthy young englishmen began taking a postoxbridge trek through france and italy in search of art culture and the roots of western civilization
with nearly unlimited funds aristocratic connections and months or years to roam they commissioned paintings perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the continentthe primary value of the grand tour it was believed laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the renaissance and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the european continent
leisure travel was associated with the industrial revolution in the united kingdom the first european country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population
initially this applied to the owners of the machinery of production the economic oligarchy factory owners and traders
these comprised the new middle class
cox kings was the first official travel company to be formed in 
the british origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names
in nice france one of the first and bestestablished holiday resorts on the french riviera the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the promenade des anglais in many other historic resorts in continental europe old wellestablished palace hotels have names like the hotel bristol hotel carlton or hotel majestic reflecting the dominance of english customers
a pioneer of the travel agency business thomas cooks idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the london road at kibworth
with the opening of the extended midland counties railway he arranged to take a group of  temperance campaigners from leicester campbell street station to a rally in loughborough eleven miles  km away
on july  thomas cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person this included rail tickets and food for the journey
cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers as the railway tickets being legal contracts between company and passenger could not have been issued at his own price
clarification needed this was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous unadvertised private excursion trains
 during the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and sunday school children
in  the midland counties railway company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him provided he found the passengers
this success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure taking a percentage of the railway fares
in  he planned his first excursion abroad when he took a group from leicester to calais to coincide with the paris exhibition
the following year he started his grand circular tours of europe
during the s he took parties to switzerland italy egypt and the united states
cook established inclusive independent travel whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route
such was his success that the scottish railway companies withdrew their support between  and  to try the excursion business for themselves
the tourism industry as part of the service sector has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries
the manila declaration on world tourism of  recognized its importance as an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social cultural educational and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations
tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists accounting as of update for  of the worlds trade in services and as an invisible export for  of overall exports of goods and services
it also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism
it is also claimed that travel broadens the mind
the hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services such as airlines cruise ships transits trains and taxicabs lodging including hotels hostels homestays resorts and renting out rooms and entertainment venues such as amusement parks restaurants casinos festivals shopping malls music venues and theatres
this is in addition to goods bought by tourists including souvenirs
on the flipside tourism can degrade people
and sour relationships between host and guest
the economic foundations of tourism are essentially the cultural assets the cultural property and the nature of the travel location
the world heritage sites are particularly worth mentioning today because they are real tourism magnets
but even a countrys current or former form of government can be decisive for tourism
for example the fascination of the british royal family brings millions of tourists to great britain every year and thus the economy around  million a year
the habsburg family can be mentioned in central europe
according to estimates the habsburg brand should generate tourism sales of  million euros per year for vienna alone
the tourist principle habsburg sells applies
cultural and natural heritage are in many cases the absolute basis for worldwide tourism
cultural tourism is one of the megatrends that is reflected in massive numbers of overnight stays and sales
as unesco is increasingly observing the cultural heritage is needed for tourism but also endangered by it
the icomos international cultural tourism charter from  is already dealing with all of these problems
as a result of the tourist hazard for example the lascaux cave was rebuilt for tourists
overtourism is an important buzzword in this area
furthermore the focus of unesco in war zones is to ensure the protection of cultural heritage in order to maintain this future important economic basis for the local population
and there is intensive cooperation between unesco the united nations the united nations peacekeeping and blue shield international
there are extensive international and national considerations studies and programs to protect cultural assets from the effects of tourism and those from war
in particular it is also about training civilian and military personnel
but the involvement of the locals is particularly important
the founding president of blue shield international karl von habsburg summed it up with the words without the local community and without the local participants that would be completely impossible
cruising is a popular form of water tourism
leisure cruise ships were introduced by the peninsular oriental steam navigation company po in  sailing from southampton to destinations such as gibraltar malta and athens
in  german businessman albert ballin sailed the ship augusta victoria from hamburg into the mediterranean sea
june saw the launching of the first purposebuilt cruise ship was prinzessin victoria luise built in hamburg for the hamburg america line
many leisureoriented tourists travel to seaside resorts on their nearest coast or further afield
coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter
academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on prescheduled tours usually under the organization of tourism professionals
this form of tourism developed during the second half of the th century in the united kingdom and was pioneered by thomas cook
cook took advantage of europes rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to the masses in addition to longer holidays to continental europe india asia and the western hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers
by the s over  tourists per year used thomas cook son
the relationship between tourism companies transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism
cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads
one contemporary form of mass tourism package tourism still incorporates the partnership between these three groups
travel developed during the early th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes
improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time
in continental europe early seaside resorts included heiligendamm founded in  at the baltic sea being the first seaside resort ostend popularised by the people of brussels boulognesurmer and deauville for the parisians taormina in sicily

st moritz switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the s hotel manager johannes badrutt invited some summer guests from england to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape thereby inaugurating a popular trend
it was however only in the s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the swiss ski resorts
even in winter up to one third of all guests depending on the location consist of nonskiers
major ski resorts are located mostly in the various european countries eg
andorra austria bulgaria bosniaherzegovina croatia czech republic cyprus finland france germany greece iceland italy norway latvia lithuania poland romania serbia sweden slovakia slovenia spain switzerland turkey canada the united states eg
montana utah colorado california wyoming vermont new hampshire new york argentina new zealand japan south korea chile and lebanon
there has been an uptrend in tourism over the last few decadesvague especially in europe where international travel for short breaks is common
tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them
for example some people prefer simple beach vacations while others want more specialized holidays quieter resorts familyoriented holidays or niche markettargeted destination hotels
the developments in air transport infrastructure such as jumbo jets lowcost airlines and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable
a major factor in the relatively low cost of air travel is the tax exemption for aviation fuels
the who estimated in  that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time
 there have also been changes in lifestyle for example some retirementage people sustain yearround tourism
this is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services
some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailormade package requested by the customer upon impulse
there have been a few setbacks in tourism such as the september  attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as in bali and several european cities
also on  december  a tsunami caused by the  indian ocean earthquake hit the asian countries on the indian ocean including the maldives
thousands of lives were lost including many tourists
this together with the vast cleanup operations stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time
individual lowprice or even zeroprice overnight stays have become more popular in the s especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like couchsurfing and airbnb being established
there has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of gdp is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism as has occurred for instance in dubai
sustainable tourism is a concept that covers the complete tourism experience including concern for economic social and environmental issues as well as attention to improving tourists experiences and addressing the needs of host communities
sustainable tourism emerged as an outcome of preventing the uncontrolled and excessive use of mountain tourism resources and attractions in sumadija and western serbia
sustainable tourism should embrace concerns for environmental protection social equity and the quality of life cultural diversity and a dynamic viable economy delivering jobs and prosperity for all
ecotourism also known as ecological tourism is responsible travel to fragile pristine and usually protected areas that strives to be lowimpact and often smallscale
it helps educate the traveller provides funds for conservation directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights

tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior
volunteer tourism or voluntourism is growing as a largely western phenomenon with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities
wearing  defines volunteer tourism as applying to those tourists who for various reasons volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society
vso was founded in the uk in  and the us peace corps was subsequently founded in 
these were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism
this form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism
however increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour and force unwilling host communities to adopt western initiatives while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist
increasingly organisations such as vso have been concerned with communitycentric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people
propoor tourism which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development the issue has been addressed through smallscale projects in local communities and through attempts by ministries of tourism to attract large numbers of tourists
research by the overseas development institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists money to reach the poorest as only  or less far less in some cases ever reaches the poor successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountainclimbing in tanzania and cultural tourism in luang prabang laos
there is also the possibility of propoor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world
recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis
recession tourism is defined by lowcost and highvalue experiences taking place at oncepopular generic retreats
various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travellers are elongating trips where their money travels further
this concept is not widely used in tourism research
it is related to the shortlived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation
when there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure particularly in southeast asia india sri lanka eastern europe cuba and canada where there are different regulatory regimes in relation to particular medical procedures eg
dentistry travelling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as medical tourism
educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of the classroom environment
brent w ritchie publisher of managing educational tourism created a study of a geographic subdivision to demonstrate how tourism educated high school students participating in foreign exchange programs over the last  years
in educational tourism the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture study tours or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment such as in the international practicum training program
in  one impact was many exchange students traveled to america to assist students financially in order to maintain their secondary education
this type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the cityregion
this type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience
creating a sustainable atmosphere creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices
an example of event tourism would be the music festival south by southwest that is hosted in austin texas annually
every year people from all over the world flock to the city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see bands perform
people are drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which defines event tourism
creative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism since the early beginnings of tourism itself
its european roots date back to the time of the grand tour which saw the sons of aristocratic families travelling for the purpose of mostly interactive educational experiences
more recently creative tourism has been given its own name by crispin raymond and greg richards who as members of the association for tourism and leisure education atlas have directed a number of projects for the european commission including cultural and crafts tourism known as sustainable tourism
they have defined creative tourism as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the culture of the host community through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences
meanwhile the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by highprofile organizations such as unesco who through the creative cities network have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place
unesco wrote in one of its documents creative tourism involves more interaction in which the visitor has an educational emotional social and participative interaction with the place its living culture and the people who live there
they feel like a citizen
saying so the tourist will have the opportunity to take part in workshops classes and activities related to the culture of the destination
more recently creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism drawing on active participation by travellers in the culture of the host communities they visit
several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development including the united kingdom austria france the bahamas jamaica spain italy new zealand and south korea
the growing interest of tourists in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism highlighting the intangible heritage craft workshops cooking classes etc
and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure for example through the rent of halls and auditoriums
experiential travel or immersion travel is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry
it is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country city or particular place by connecting to its history people food and culture
the term experiential travel has been mentioned in publications since  but it was not discovered as a meaningful market trend until much later
one emerging area of special interest has been identified by lennon and foley  as dark tourism
this type of tourism involves visits to dark sites such as battlegrounds scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide for example concentration camps
its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs
philip stone argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining ones own death through the real death of others
erik h cohen introduces the term populo sites to evidence the educational character of dark tourism
popular sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors
based on a study at yad vashem the shoah holocaust memorial museum in jerusalem a new term in populo is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell
learning about the shoah in jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in europe but equally authentic
it is argued that a dichotomy between authentic sites at the location of a tragedy and created sites elsewhere is insufficient
participants evaluations of seminars for european teachers at yad vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject
implications for other cases of dark tourism at in populo locations are discussed
in this vein peter tarlow defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths which continue to impact our lives
this issue can not be understood without the figure of trauma
victoria mitchell et al
suggest that dark tourism seems to be a heterogeneous discipline
there is a great dispersion of definitions knowledge production and meanings revolving around the term
in fact dark tourism practices vary in culture and time
qualitative speaking dark tourism experience is pretty different from leisure practices
to fill the gap the existent definitions should be catalogued in subcategories to form an allencompassing model that expands the current understanding of dark tourism
in consonance with this m apleni et al
argue dark tourism helps the industry not to be fragmented before the ongoing states of crises the activity often faces
they cite the case of terrorism which paves the way for the construction of a new dark site
dark tourism plays a leading role not only in enhancing destination resilience but also in helping communities to deal with traumatic experiences
social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation
it includes youth hostels and lowpriced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations trade unions or in communist times publicly owned enterprises
in may  at the second congress of social tourism in austria walter hunziker proposed the following definition social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by lowincome groups and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services
also known as tourism of doom or last chance tourism this emerging trend involves travelling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened such as the ice caps of mount kilimanjaro the melting glaciers of patagonia or the coral of the great barrier reef before it is too late
identified by travel trade magazine travel age west editorinchief kenneth shapiro in  and later explored in the new york times this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise
some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming overpopulation or climate change
others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individuals carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing
religious tourism in particular pilgrimage can serve to strengthen faith and to demonstrate devotion both of which are central tenets of many major religions
need quotation to verify religious tourists may seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their selfidentity in a positive manner
given this the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious selfidentity or not
dna tourism also called ancestry tourism or heritage travel is tourism based on dna testing
these tourists visit their remote relatives or places where their ancestors came from or where their relatives reside based on the results of dna tests
dna testing became a growing trend in 
tourism brings both positive and negative impacts on tourist destinations
the traditionallydescribed domains of tourism impacts are economic sociocultural and environmental dimensions
the economic effects of tourism include improved tax revenue and personal income increased standards of living and more employment opportunities
sociocultural impacts are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds attitudes and behaviors and relationships to material goods
environmental impacts can have both direct effects including degradation of habitat vegetation air quality bodies of water the water table wildlife and changes in natural phenomena and indirect effects such as increased harvesting of natural resources to supply food indirect air and water pollution including from flights transport and the manufacture of food and souvenirs for tourists
excessive hordes of visitors or of the wrong sort of visitors can provoke backlashes from otherwise friendly hosts in popular destinations
negative environmental consequences related to tourism activities such as greenhouse gas emissions from air travel and litter at popular locations can be significant
tourism is sometimes associated with export or theft of contraband such as endangered species or certain cultural artifacts and illegal sex trade activities
in recent yearswhen
the local population in many areas has developed antitourism sentiment and begun to protest against tourists
one of the most prominent examples of such a mobilization was the socalled tourists go home movement which emerged in  in spain due to slogans and mottos calling the tourists to go back to their homes
