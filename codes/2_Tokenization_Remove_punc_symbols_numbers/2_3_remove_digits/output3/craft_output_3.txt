an anvil is a metalworking tool consisting of a large block of metal usually forged or cast steel with a flattened top surface upon which another object is struck or worked
anvils are as massive as is practical because the higher their inertia the more efficiently they cause the energy of striking tools to be transferred to the work piece
in most cases the anvil is used as a forging tool
before the advent of modern welding technology it was a primary tool of metal workers
the great majority of modern anvils are made of cast steel that has been heat treated by either flame or electric induction
inexpensive anvils have been made of cast iron and low quality steel but are considered unsuitable for serious use as they deform and lack rebound when struck
the primary work surface of the anvil is known as the face
it is generally made of hardened steel and should be flat and smooth with rounded edges for most work
any marks on the face will be transferred to the work
also sharp edges tend to cut into the metal being worked and may cause cracks to form in the workpiece
the face is hardened and tempered to resist the blows of the smiths hammer so the anvil face does not deform under repeated use
a hard anvil face also reduces the amount of force lost in each hammer blow
hammers tools and work pieces of hardened steel should never directly strike the anvil face with full force as they may damage it this can result in chipping or deforming of the anvil face
the horn of the anvil is a conical projection used to form various round shapes and is generally unhardened steel or iron
the horn is used mostly in bending operations
it also is used by some smiths as an aid in drawing down stock making it longer and thinner
some anvils mainly european are made with two horns one square and one round
also some anvils are made with side horns or clips for specialized work
the step is the area of the anvil between the horn and the face
it is soft and is used for cutting its purpose is to prevent damaging the steel face of the anvil by conducting such operations there and so as not to damage the cutting edge of the chisel though many smiths shun this practice as it will damage the anvil over time
there have also been other additions to the anvil such as an upsetting block this is used to upset steel generally in long stripsbars as it is placed between the feet of the anvil
upsetting is a technique often used by blacksmiths for making the steel workpiece short and thick having probably been originally long and thin
the hardy hole is a square hole into which specialized forming and cutting tools called hardy tools are placed
it is also used in punching and bending operations
the pritchel hole is a small round hole that is present on most modern anvils
some anvils have more than one
it is used mostly for punching
at times smiths will fit a second tool to this hole to allow the smith more flexibility when using more than one anvil tool
an anvil needs to be placed upon a sturdy base made from an impact and fire resistant material
it requires being fastened firmly to the base so it will not move when struck with a hammer
a loose anvil is extremely unsafe as it can fall off the base and is an ineffective forging tool
common methods of attaching an anvil are spikes chains steel or iron straps clips bolts where there are holes provided and cables
a smith would use whatever was at hand as long as it held the anvil firmly in place
the anvil is placed as near to the forge as is convenient generally no more than one step from the forge to prevent heat loss in the work piece
the most common base traditionally was a hard wood log or large timber buried several feet into the floor of the forge shop
this was done to make the anvil immobile when heavy forging and bending were done upon the anvil
in the industrial era cast iron bases became available
they had the advantage of adding additional weight to the anvil making it more stable while making the anvil movable
these bases are highly sought after by collectors today
when concrete became widely available there was a trend to make steel reinforced anvil bases by some smiths though this practice has largely been abandoned
in more modern times many anvils have been placed upon bases fabricated from steel often a short thick section of a large ibeam
in addition bases have been made from dimensional lumber bolted together to form a large block or steel drums full of oilsaturated sand to provide a damping effect
in recent times tripod bases of fabricated steel have become popular with some smiths
there are many designs for anvils which are often tailored for a specific purpose or to meet the needs of a particular smith
for example there were anvils specifically made for farriers general smiths cutlers chain makers armorers saw tuners coach makers coopers and many other types of metal workers
most of these anvil types look similar but some are radically different
saw maker anvils for instance are generally a large rectangular block of steel
bladesmith anvils tend to be rectangular with a hardy and pritchel but no horn
such designs have originated in diverse geographic locations
the common blacksmiths anvil is made of either forged or cast steel forged wrought iron with a hard steel face or cast iron with a hard steel face
cast iron anvils are not used for forging as they are incapable of standing up to the impact and will crack and dent
also cast iron anvils without a hard steel face do not have the rebound that a harder anvil would and will tire out the smith
historically some anvils have been made with a smooth top working face of hardened steel welded to a cast iron or wrought iron body though this manufacturing method is no longer in use
at one end the common smiths anvil has a projecting conical bick beak horn used for hammering curved work pieces
the other end is typically called the heel
occasionally the other end is also provided with a bick partly rectangular in section
most anvils made since the late th century also have a hardy hole and a pritchel hole where various tools such as the anvilcutter or hot chisel can be inserted and held by the anvil
some anvils have several hardy and pritchel holes to accommodate a wider variety of hardy tools and pritchels
an anvil may also have a softer pad for chisel work
an anvil for a power hammer is usually supported on a massive anvil block sometimes weighing over  tons for a ton hammer this again rests on a strong foundation of timber and masonry or concrete
an anvil may have a marking indicating its weight manufacturer or place of origin
americanmade anvils were often marked in pounds
european anvils are sometimes marked in kilograms
english anvils were often marked in hundredweight the marking consisting of three numbers indicating hundredweight quarter hundredweight and pounds
for example a  if such an anvil existed would be lb lb  lb  lb  kg
cheap anvils made from inferior steel or cast iron and often sold at retail hardware stores are considered unsuitable for serious use and are often derisively referred to as asos or anvil shaped objects
 amateur smiths have used lengths of railroad rail forklift tines or even simple blocks of steel as makeshift anvils
a metalworking vise may have a small anvil integrated into its design
anvils were first made of stone as a lithic stone tool then bronze and later wrought iron
as steel became more readily available anvils were faced with it
this was done to give the anvil a hard face and to stop the anvil from deforming from impact
many regional styles of anvils evolved through time from the simple block that was first used by smiths
the majority of anvils found today in the us are based on the london pattern anvil of the midth century
the wrought iron steel faced anvil was produced up until the early th century
through the th and very early th centuries this method of construction evolved to produce extremely high quality anvils
the basic process involved forgewelding billets of wrought iron together to produce the desired shape
the sequence and location of the forgewelds varied between different anvil makers and the kind of anvil being made
at the same time cast iron anvils with steel faces were being made in the united states
at the dawn of the th century solid cast steel anvils began to be produced as well as two piece forged anvils made from closed die forgings
modern anvils are generally made entirely from steel
there are many references to anvils in ancient greek and egyptian writings including homers works
they have been found at the calico early man site in north america
anvils have since lost their former commonness along with the smiths who used them
mechanized production has made cheap and abundant manufactured goods readily available
the oneoff handmade products of the blacksmith are less economically viable in the modern world while in the past they were an absolute necessity
however anvils are still used by blacksmiths and metal workers of all kinds in producing custom work
they are also essential to the work done by farriers
application of the principles of the anvil predate historical human practice there being a fair number of examples among various species of animals
some of the most thoroughly documented ethological examples of tool use by animals in the wild were of chimpanzees observed using hammers of wood or stone to crack nuts with logs or rocks serving as anvils
less formally birds such as some species of thrush have been known for centuries to crack the shells of the snails they feed on by striking them on rocks
other species of birds have similar habits notably some of the tropical pittas and individual birds of many such species have their own particular anvils where their discarded shell middens accumulate
anvils being by some definitions proto or borderline tools not directly manipulated and not detached from the substrate some workers argue that their use is less demanding of brain power than more sophisticated tools and they accordingly are likely to be used by organisms of a wider range of organisation of the central nervous system than say probes hammers hooks and scoops
the latter would be limited to species with correspondingly advanced mental powers
certainly anvil use occurs very widely in nature ranging from fishes that break open the shells of molluscs much as thrushes do to sea otters that bring stones to the surface and drift on their backs holding the stones on their chests as anvils on which they break open clams and similar hardshelled prey
gulls of various species some crows and large birds of prey smash open hard food items such as bones and tortoises by dropping them onto rocks
anvil firing is the practice of firing an anvil into the air using gunpowder
it has been popular in california the eastern united states and the southern united states much like how fireworks are used today
there is a growing interest in reenacting this ancient tradition in the us which has now spread to england
a typical metalworkers anvil with horn at one end and flat face at the other is a standard prop for cartoon gags as the epitome of a heavy and clumsy object that is perfect for dropping onto an antagonist
this visual metaphor is common for example in warner brothers looney tunes and merrie melodies shorts such as those with wile e coyote and the road runner
anvils in cartoons were also referenced in an episode of gilmore girls where one of the main characters tries to have a conversation about where did all the anvils go
a reference to their falling out of use on a general scale
animaniacs made frequent gags on the topic throughout its run even having a kingdom named anvilania whose sole national product is anvils
hephaestus the blacksmith of the greek gods used an anvil when metalworking on hercules 
dwarves were blacksmiths who used anvils for metalworking on cslewiss the chronicles of narnia most iconically on the magicians nephew and prince caspian as well as on jrr
tolkiens the hobbit
anvils have been used as percussion instruments in several famous musical compositions including
wagners ring des nibelungen is notable in using the anvil as pitched percussion
the vast majority of extant works use the anvil as unpitched
however tuned anvils are available as musical instruments albeit unusual
these are not to be confused with the sawyers anvils used to tune big circular saw blades
steel anvils are used for tuning for use as musical instruments because those based partly on cast iron and similar materials give a duller sound this is actually valued in industry as pure steel anvils are troublesomely noisy though energetically more efficient
the hammer and anvil have enjoyed varying popularity in orchestral roles
robert donington pointed out that sebastian virdung notes them in his book of  and martin agricola includes it in his list of instruments musica instrumentalis deudsch  largely as a compliment to pythagoras
in premodern or modern times anvils occasionally appear in operatic works by berlioz bizet gounod verdi and wagner for example
commonly pairs of anvils tuned a third apart are used
in practice modern orchestras commonly substitute a brake drum or other suitable steel structure that is easier to tune than an actual anvil although a visibly convincing anvilshaped prop may be shown as desired
in das rheingold wagner scored for nine little six midsized and three large anvils but orchestras seldom can afford instrumentation on such a scale
a blacksmith is a metalsmith who creates objects from wrought iron or steel by forging the metal using tools to hammer bend and cut cf
tinsmith
blacksmiths produce objects such as gates grilles railings light fixtures furniture sculpture tools agricultural implements decorative and religious items cooking utensils and weapons
there was an historical opposition between the heavy work of the blacksmith and the more delicate operation of a whitesmith who usually worked in gold silver pewter or the finishing steps of fine steel
the place where a blacksmith works is called variously a smithy a forge or a blacksmiths shop
while there are many people who work with metal such as farriers wheelwrights and armorers in former times the blacksmith had a general knowledge of how to make and repair many things from the most complex of weapons and armor to simple things like nails or lengths of chain
the black in blacksmith refers to the black firescale a layer of oxides that forms on the surface of the metal during heating
the origin of smith is debated it may come from the old english word smythe meaning to strike or it may have originated from the protogerman smithaz meaning skilled worker
blacksmiths work by heating pieces of wrought iron or steel until the metal becomes soft enough for shaping with hand tools such as a hammer an anvil and a chisel
heating generally takes place in a forge fueled by propane natural gas coal charcoal coke or oil
some modern blacksmiths may also employ an oxyacetylene or similar blowtorch for more localized heating
induction heating methods are gaining popularity among modern blacksmiths
color is important for indicating the temperature and workability of the metal
as iron heats to higher temperatures it first glows red then orange yellow and finally white
the ideal heat for most forging is the bright yelloworange color that indicates forging heat
because they must be able to see the glowing color of the metal some blacksmiths work in dim lowlight conditions but most work in welllit conditions
the key is to have consistent lighting but not too bright
direct sunlight obscures the colors
the techniques of smithing can be roughly divided into forging sometimes called sculpting welding heattreating and finishing
forging the process smiths use to shape metal by hammering differs from machining in that forging does not remove material
instead the smith hammers the iron into shape
even punching and cutting operations except when trimming waste by smiths usually rearrange metal around the hole rather than drilling it out as swarf
forging uses seven basic operations or techniques
drawing down
shrinking a type of upsetting
bending
upsetting
swaging
punching
forge weldingthese operations generally require at least a hammer and anvil but smiths also use other tools and techniques to accommodate oddsized or repetitive jobs
drawing lengthens the metal by reducing one or both of the other two dimensions
as the depth is reduced or the width narrowed the piece is lengthened or drawn out
as an example of drawing a smith making a chisel might flatten a square bar of steel lengthening the metal reducing its depth but keeping its width consistent
drawing does not have to be uniform
a taper can result as in making a wedge or a woodworking chisel blade
if tapered in two dimensions a point results
drawing can be accomplished with a variety of tools and methods
two typical methods using only hammer and anvil would be hammering on the anvil horn and hammering on the anvil face using the cross peen of a hammer
another method for drawing is to use a tool called a fuller or the peen of the hammer to hasten the drawing out of a thick piece of metal
the technique is called fullering from the tool
fullering consists of hammering a series of indentations with corresponding ridges perpendicular to the long section of the piece being drawn
the resulting effect looks somewhat like waves along the top of the piece
then the smith turns the hammer over to use the flat face to hammer the tops of the ridges down level with the bottoms of the indentations
this forces the metal to grow in length and width if left unchecked much faster than just hammering with the flat face of the hammer
heating iron to a forging heat allows bending as if it were a soft ductile metal like copper or silver
bending can be done with the hammer over the horn or edge of the anvil or by inserting a bending fork into the hardy hole the square hole in the top of the anvil placing the work piece between the tines of the fork and bending the material to the desired angle
bends can be dressed and tightened or widened by hammering them over the appropriately shaped part of the anvil
some metals are hot short meaning they lose their tensile strength when heated
they become like plasticine although they may still be manipulated by squeezing an attempt to stretch them even by bending or twisting is likely to have them crack and break apart
this is a problem for some blademaking steels which must be worked carefully to avoid developing hidden cracks that would cause failure in the future
though rarely handworked titanium is notably hot short
even such common smithing processes as decoratively twisting a bar are impossible with it
upsetting is the process of making metal thicker in one dimension through shortening in the other
one form is to heat the end of a rod and then hammer on it as one would drive a nail the rod gets shorter and the hot part widens
an alternative to hammering on the hot end is to place the hot end on the anvil and hammer on the cold end
punching may be done to create a decorative pattern or to make a hole
for example in preparation for making a hammerhead a smith would punch a hole in a heavy bar or rod for the hammer handle
punching is not limited to depressions and holes
it also includes cutting slitting and drifting all done with a chisel
the five basic forging processes are often combined to produce and refine the shapes necessary for finished products
for example to fashion a crosspeen hammer head a smith would start with a bar roughly the diameter of the hammer face the handle hole would be punched and drifted widened by inserting or passing a larger tool through it the head would be cut punched but with a wedge the peen would be drawn to a wedge and the face would be dressed by upsetting
as with making a chisel since it is lengthened by drawing it would also tend to spread in width
a smith would therefore frequently turn the chiseltobe on its side and hammer it back down upsetting it to check the spread and keep the metal at the correct width
or if a smith needed to put a degree bend in a bar and wanted a sharp corner on the outside of the bend they would begin by hammering an unsupported end to make the curved bend
then to fatten up the outside radius of the bend one or both arms of the bend would need to be pushed back to fill the outer radius of the curve
so they would hammer the ends of the stock down into the bend upsetting it at the point of the bend
they would then dress the bend by drawing the sides of the bend to keep the correct thickness
the hammering would continue upsetting and then drawing until the curve had been properly shaped
in the primary operation was the bend but the drawing and upsetting are done to refine the shape
welding is the joining of the same or similar kind of metal
a modern blacksmith has a range of options and tools to accomplish this
the basic types of welding commonly employed in a modern workshop include traditional forge welding as well as modern methods including oxyacetylene and arc welding
in forge welding the pieces to join are heated to what is generally referred to as welding heat
for mild steel most smiths judge this temperature by color the metal glows an intense yellow or white
at this temperature the steel is near molten
any foreign material in the weld such as the oxides or scale that typically form in the fire can weaken it and cause it to fail
thus the mating surfaces to be joined must be kept clean
to this end a smith makes sure the fire is a reducing fire a fire where at the heart there is a great deal of heat and very little oxygen
the smith also carefully shapes mating faces so that as they come together foreign material squeezes out as the metal is joined
to clean the faces protect them from oxidation and provide a medium to carry foreign material out of the weld the smith sometimes uses flux typically powdered borax silica sand or both
the smith first cleans parts to be joined with a wire brush then puts them in the fire to heat
with a mix of drawing and upsetting the smith shapes the faces so that when finally brought together the center of the weld connects first and the connection spreads outward under the hammer blows pushing out the flux if used and foreign material
the dressed metal goes back in the fire is brought near to welding heat removed from the fire and brushed
flux is sometimes applied which prevents oxygen from reaching and burning the metal during forging and it is returned to the fire
the smith now watches carefully to avoid overheating the metal
there is some challenge to this because to see the color of the metal the smith must remove it from the fire exposing it to air which can rapidly oxidize it
so the smith might probe into the fire with a bit of steel wire prodding lightly at the mating faces
when the end of the wire sticks on to the metal it is at the right temperature a small weld forms where the wire touches the mating face so it sticks
the smith commonly places the metal in the fire so he can see it without letting surrounding air contact the surface
note that smiths dont always use flux especially in the uk
now the smith moves with rapid purpose quickly taking the metal from the fire to the anvil and bringing the mating faces together
a few light hammer taps bring the mating faces into complete contact and squeeze out the flux and finally the smith returns the work to the fire
the weld begins with the taps but often the joint is weak and incomplete so the smith reheats the joint to welding temperature and works the weld with light blows to set the weld and finally to dress it to the shape
depending on the intended use of the piece a blacksmith may finish it in a number of ways
a simple jig a tool that the smith might only use a few times in the shop may get the minimum of finishing a rap on the anvil to break off scale and a brushing with a wire brush
files bring a piece to final shape removing burrs and sharp edges and smoothing the surface
heat treatment and casehardening achieve the desired hardness
the wire brush as a hand tool or power tool can further smooth brighten and polish surfaces
grinding stones abrasive paper and emery wheels can further shape smooth and polish the surfacea range of treatments and finishes can inhibit oxidation and enhance or change the appearance of the piece
an experienced smith selects the finish based on the metal and on the intended use of the item
finishes include among others paint varnish bluing browning oil and wax
a blacksmiths striker is an assistant frequently an apprentice whose job is to swing a large sledgehammer in heavy forging operations as directed by the blacksmith
in practice the blacksmith holds the hot iron at the anvil with tongs in one hand and indicates where to strike the iron by tapping it with a small hammer in the other hand
the striker then delivers a heavy blow to the indicated spot with a sledgehammer
during the th century and into the st century this role has become increasingly unnecessary and automated through the use of trip hammers or reciprocating power hammers
when iron ore is smelted into usable metal a certain amount of carbon is usually alloyed with the iron
charcoal is almost pure carbon
the amount of carbon significantly affects the properties of the metal
if the carbon content is over  the metal is called cast iron because it has a relatively low melting point and is easily cast
it is quite brittle however and can not be forged so therefore not used for blacksmithing
if the carbon content is between  and  the resulting metal is tool grade steel which can be heat treated as discussed above
when the carbon content is below  the metal is either wrought iron wrought iron is not smelted and can not come from this process or mild steel
the terms are never interchangeable
in preindustrial times the material of choice for blacksmiths was wrought iron
this iron had a very low carbon content and also included up to  of glassy iron silicate slag in the form of numerous very fine stringers
this slag content made the iron very tough gave it considerable resistance to rusting and allowed it to be more easily forge welded a process in which the blacksmith permanently joins two pieces of iron or a piece of iron and a piece of steel by heating them nearly to a white heat and hammering them together
forge welding is more difficult with modern mild steel because it welds in a narrower temperature band
the fibrous nature of wrought iron required knowledge and skill to properly form any tool which would be subject to stress
modern steel is produced using either the blast furnace or arc furnaces
wrought iron was produced by a laborintensive process called puddling so this material is now a difficulttofind specialty product
modern blacksmiths generally substitute mild steel for making objects traditionally of wrought iron
sometimes they use electrolyticprocess pure iron
many blacksmiths also incorporate materials such as bronze copper or brass in artistic products
aluminum and titanium may also be forged by the blacksmiths process
each material responds differently under the hammer and must be separately studied by the blacksmith
iron is a naturally occurring metallic element
it is almost never found in its native form pure iron in nature
it is usually found as an oxide or sulfide with many other impurity elements mixed in
wrought iron is the purest form of iron generally encountered or produced in quantity
it may contain as little as  carbon by weight
from its traditional method of manufacture wrought iron has a fibrous internal texture
quality wroughtiron blacksmithing takes the direction of these fibers into account during forging since the strength of the material is stronger in line with the grain than across the grain
most of the remaining impurities from the initial smelting become concentrated in silicate slag trapped between the iron fibers
this slag produces a lucky side effect during forgewelding
when the silicate melts it makes wrought iron selffluxing
the slag becomes a liquid glass that covers the exposed surfaces of the wrought iron preventing oxidation which would otherwise interfere with the successful welding process
steel is an alloy of iron and between  and  carbon by weight
the presence of carbon allows steel to assume one of several different crystalline configurations
macroscopically this is seen as the ability to turn the hardness of a piece of steel on and off through various processes of heattreatment
if the concentration of carbon is held constant this is a reversible process
steel with a higher carbon percentage may be brought to a higher state of maximum hardness
cast iron is iron that contains between  to  carbon by weight
there is so much carbon present that the hardness can not be switched off
hence cast iron is a brittle metal which can break like glass
cast iron can not be forged without special heat treatment to convert it to malleable ironsteel with less than  carbon content can not be hardened enough by simple heattreatment to make useful hardenedsteel tools
hence in what follows wroughtiron lowcarbonsteel and other soft unhardenable iron varieties are referred to indiscriminately as just iron
in hindu mythology tvastar also known as vishvakarma is the blacksmith of the devas
the earliest references of tvastar can be found in the rigveda
hephaestus latin vulcan was the blacksmith of the gods in greek and roman mythology
a supremely skilled artisan whose forge was a volcano he constructed most of the weapons of the gods as well as beautiful assistants for his smithy and a metal fishingnet of astonishing intricacy
he was the god of metalworking fire and craftsmen
in celtic mythology the role of smith is held by eponymous their names do mean smith characters goibhniu irish myths of the tuatha dé danann cycle or gofannon welsh myths the mabinogion
in the nart mythology of the caucasus the hero known to the ossetians as kurdalægon and the circassians as tlepsh is a blacksmith and skilled craftsman whose exploits exhibit shamanic features sometimes bearing comparison to those of the scandinavian deity odin
one of his greatest feats is acting as a type of male midwife to the hero xamyc who has been made the carrier of the embryo of his son batraz by his dying wife the watersprite lady isp who spits it between his shoulder blades where it forms a womblike cyst
kurdalaegon prepares a type of tower or scaffold above a quenching bath for xamyc and when the time is right lances the cyst to liberate the infant hero batraz as a newborn babe of whitehot steel whom kurdalægon then quenches like a newly forged sword
the anglosaxon wayland smith known in old norse as völundr is a heroic blacksmith in germanic mythology
the poetic edda states that he forged beautiful gold rings set with wonderful gems
he was captured by king níðuðr who cruelly hamstrung him and imprisoned him on an island
völundr eventually had his revenge by killing níðuðrs sons and fashioning goblets from their skulls jewels from their eyes and a brooch from their teeth
he then raped the kings daughter after drugging her with strong beer and escaped laughing on wings of his own making boasting that he had fathered a child upon her
seppo ilmarinen the eternal hammerer blacksmith and inventor in the kalevala is an archetypal artificer from finnish mythologytubalcain is mentioned in the book of genesis of the torah as the original smith
ogun the god of blacksmiths warriors hunters and others who work with iron is one of the pantheon of orisha traditionally worshipped by the yoruba people of nigeria
gold silver and copper all occur in nature in their native states as reasonably pure metals humans probably worked these metals first
these metals are all quite malleable and humans initial development of hammering techniques was undoubtedly applied to these metals
during the chalcolithic era and the bronze age humans in the mideast learned how to smelt melt cast rivet and to a limited extent forge copper and bronze
bronze is an alloy of copper and approximately  to  tin
bronze is superior to just copper by being harder being more resistant to corrosion and by having a lower melting point thereby requiring less fuel to melt and cast
much of the copper used by the mediterranean world came from the island of cyprus
most of the tin came from the cornwall region of the island of great britain transported by seaborne phoenician and greek traders
copper and bronze can not be hardened by heattreatment they can only be hardened by cold working
to accomplish this a piece of bronze is lightly hammered for a long period of time
the localized stresscycling causes work hardening by changing the size and shape of the metals crystals
the hardened bronze can then be ground to sharpen it to make edged tools
clocksmiths as recently as the th century used work hardening techniques to harden the teeth of brass gears and ratchets
tapping on just the teeth produced harder teeth with superior wearresistance
by contrast the rest of the gear was left in a softer and tougher state more capable of resisting cracking
bronze is sufficiently corrosionresistant that artifacts of bronze may last thousands of years relatively unscathed
accordingly museums frequently preserve more examples of bronze age metalwork than examples of artifacts from the much younger iron age
buried iron artifacts may completely rust away in less than  years
examples of ancient iron work still extant are very much the exception to the norm
concurrent with the advent of alphabetic characters in the iron age humans became aware of the metal iron
in earlier ages irons qualities in contrast to those of bronze were not generally understood though
iron artifacts composed of meteoric iron have the chemical composition containing up to  nickel
as this source of this iron is extremely rare and fortuitous little development of smithing skills peculiar to iron can be assumed to have occurred
that we still possess any such artifacts of meteoric iron may be ascribed to the vagaries of climate and the increased corrosionresistance conferred on iron by the presence of nickel
during the north polar exploration of the early th century inughuit northern greenlandic inuit were found to be making iron knives from two particularly large nickeliron meteors
one of these meteors was taken to washington dc where it was remitted to the custody of the smithsonian institution
the hittites of anatolia first discovered or developed the smelting of iron ores around  bc
they seem to have maintained a near monopoly on the knowledge of iron production for several hundred years but when their empire collapsed during the eastern mediterranean upheavals around  bc the knowledge seems to have escaped in all directions
in the iliad of homer describing the trojan war and bronze age greek and trojan warriors most of the armor and weapons swords and spears are stated to have been of bronze
iron is not unknown however as arrowheads are described as iron and a ball of iron is listed as a prize awarded for winning a competition
the events described probably occurred around  bc but homer is thought to have composed this epic poem around  bc so exactitude must remain suspect
when historical records resume after the  bc upheavals and the ensuing greek dark age iron work and presumably blacksmiths seem to have sprung like athena fullygrown from the head of zeus
very few artifacts remain due to loss from corrosion and reuse of iron as a valuable commodity
what information exists indicates that all of the basic operations of blacksmithing were in use as soon as the iron age reached a particular locality
the scarcity of records and artifacts and the rapidity of the switch from bronze age to iron age is a reason to use evidence of bronze smithing to infer about the early development of blacksmithing
it is uncertain when iron weapons replaced bronze weapons because the earliest iron swords did not significantly improve on the qualities of existing bronze artifacts
unalloyed iron is soft does not hold an edge as well as a properly constructed bronze blade and needs more maintenance
iron ores are more widely available than the necessary materials to create bronze however which made iron weapons more economical than comparable bronze weapons
small amounts of steel are often formed during several of the earliest refining practices and when the properties of this alloy were discovered and exploited steel edged weapons greatly outclassed bronze
iron is different from most other materials including bronze in that it does not immediately go from a solid to a liquid at its melting point
ho is a solid ice at  c  f and a liquid water at  c  f
iron by contrast is definitely a solid at   but over the next   it becomes increasingly plastic and more taffylike as its temperature increases
this extreme temperature range of variable solidity is the fundamental material property upon which blacksmithing practice depends
another major difference between bronze and iron fabrication techniques is that bronze can be melted
the melting point of iron is much higher than that of bronze
in the western europe the mideast tradition the technology to make fires hot enough to melt iron did not arise until the th century when smelting operations grew large enough to require overly large bellows
these produced blastfurnace temperatures high enough to melt partially refined ores resulting in cast iron
thus cast iron frying pans and cookware did not become possible in europe until  years after the introduction of iron smelting
china in a separate developmental tradition was producing cast iron at least  years before this
although iron is quite abundant good quality steel remained rare and expensive until the industrial developments of bessemer process et al
in the s
close examination of blacksmithmade antique tools clearly shows where small pieces of steel were forgewelded into iron to provide the hardened steel cutting edges of tools notably in axes adzes chisels etc
the reuse of quality steel is another reason for the lack of artifacts
the romans who ensured that their own weapons were made with good steel noted in the th century bc that the celts of the po river valley had iron but not good steel
the romans record that during battle their celtic opponents could only swing their swords two or three times before having to step on their swords to straighten them
on the indian subcontinent wootz steel was and continues to be produced in small quantities
in southern asia and western africa blacksmiths form endogenous castes that sometimes speak distinct languages
in the medieval period blacksmithing was considered part of the set of seven mechanical arts
prior to the industrial revolution a village smithy was a staple of every town
factories and massproduction reduced the demand for blacksmithmade tools and hardware
the original fuel for forge fires was charcoal
coal did not begin to replace charcoal until the forests of first britain during the ad th century and then the eastern united states of america during the th century were largely depleted
coal can be an inferior fuel for blacksmithing because much of the worlds coal is contaminated with sulfur
sulfur contamination of iron and steel make them red short so that at red heat they become crumbly instead of plastic
coal sold and purchased for blacksmithing should be largely free of sulfur
european blacksmiths before and through the medieval era spent a great deal of time heating and hammering iron before forging it into finished articles
although they were unaware of the chemical basis they were aware that the quality of the iron was thus improved
from a scientific point of view the reducing atmosphere of the forge was both removing oxygen rust and soaking more carbon into the iron thereby developing increasingly higher grades of steel as the process was continued
during the eighteenth century agents for the sheffield cutlery industry scoured the british countryside offering new carriage springs for old
springs must be made of hardened steel
at this time the processes for making steel produced an extremely variable product quality was not ensured at the initial point of sale
springs that had survived cracking through hard use over the rough roads of the time had proven to be of a better quality steel
much of the fame of sheffield cutlery knives shears etc
was due to the extreme lengths the companies took to ensure they used highgrade steel
during the first half of the nineteenth century the us government included in their treaties with many native american tribes that the us would employ blacksmiths and strikers at army forts with the expressed purpose of providing native americans with iron tools and repair servicesduring the early to midnineteenth century both european armies as well as both the us federal and confederate armies employed blacksmiths to shoe horses and repair equipment such as wagons horse tack and artillery equipment
these smiths primarily worked at a traveling forge that when combined with a limber comprised wagons specifically designed and constructed as blacksmith shops on wheels to carry the essential equipment necessary for their work
lathes patterned largely on their woodturning counterparts had been used by some blacksmiths since the middleages
during the s henry maudslay created the first screwcutting lathe a watershed event that signaled the start of blacksmiths being replaced by machinists in factories for the hardware needs of the populace
samuel colt neither invented nor perfected interchangeable parts but his insistence and other industrialists at this time that his firearms be manufactured with this property was another step towards the obsolescence of metalworking artisans and blacksmiths

as demand for their products declined many more blacksmiths augmented their incomes by taking in work shoeing horses
a shoerofhorses was historically known as a farrier in english
with the introduction of automobiles the number of blacksmiths continued to decrease many former blacksmiths becoming the initial generation of automobile mechanics
the nadir of blacksmithing in the united states was reached during the s when most of the former blacksmiths had left the trade and few if any new people were entering the trade
by this time most of the working blacksmiths were those performing farrier work so the term blacksmith was effectively coopted by the farrier trade
in the final part of the th century forged ironwork continued to decline due to the aforementioned industrial revolution shapes of the elements in the designs of window grilles and other decorative functional items continued to contradict natural forms surfaces begin to be covered in paint cast iron elements are incorporated into the forged designs
main features of neoclassicism ironwork also referred to as louis xvi style and empire style ironwork include smooth straight bars decorative geometric elements double or oval volutes and the usage of elements from classical antiquity meander art wreaths etc
typical for this kind of ironwork is that the ironwork is painted white with gold gilded elements
during the th century various gases natural gas acetylene etc
have also come to be used as fuels for blacksmithing
while these are fine for blacksmithing iron special care must be taken when using them to blacksmith steel
each time a piece of steel is heated there is a tendency for the carbon content to leave the steel decarburization
this can leave a piece of steel with an effective layer of unhardenable iron on its surface
in a traditional charcoal or coal forge the fuel is really just carbon
in a properly regulated charcoalcoal fire the air in and immediately around the fire should be a reducing atmosphere
in this case and at elevated temperatures there is a tendency for vaporized carbon to soak into steel and iron counteracting or negating the decarburizing tendency
this is similar to the process by which a case of steel is developed on a piece of iron in preparation for case hardening
a renewed interest in blacksmithing occurred as part of the trend in doityourself and selfsufficiency that occurred during the s
currently there are many books organizations and individuals working to help educate the public about blacksmithing including local groups of smiths who have formed clubs with some of those smiths demonstrating at historical sites and living history events
some modern blacksmiths who produce decorative metalwork refer to themselves as artistblacksmiths
in  the artists blacksmiths association of north america was formed with  members
by  it had almost  members
likewise the british artist blacksmiths association was created in  with  charter members and had about  members in  and publish for members a quarterly magazine
while developed nations saw a decline and reawakening of interest in blacksmithing in many developing nations blacksmiths continued doing what blacksmiths have been doing for  years making and repairing iron and steel tools and hardware for people in their local area

bladesmithing is the art of making knives swords daggers and other blades using a forge hammer anvil and other smithing tools
bladesmiths employ a variety of metalworking techniques similar to those used by blacksmiths as well as woodworking for knife and sword handles and often leatherworking for sheaths
bladesmithing is an art that is thousands of years old and found in cultures as diverse as china japan india germany korea the middle east spain and the british isles
as with any art shrouded in history there are myths and misconceptions about the process
while traditionally bladesmithing referred to the manufacture of any blade by any means the majority of contemporary craftsmen referred to as bladesmiths are those who primarily manufacture blades by means of using a forge to shape the blade as opposed to knifemakers who form blades by use of the stock removal method although there is some overlap between both crafts
many blade smiths were known by other titles according to the kind of blade that they produced
historically speaking bladesmithing is an art that has survived and thrived over thousands of years
many different parts of the world have different styles of bladesmithing some more wellknown than others
ancient egyptians referred to iron as copper from the heavens because their lack of smelting technology limited their accessible iron supplies to what little native iron they could recover from meteorites
despite irons rarity they gained enough familiarity with ironworking techniques to have used wrought iron in the manufacture of swords and blades as early as  bc
they exported this technique to assyria babylon and greece through trade and as they conquered other lands and were conquered themselves
the protoceltic hallstatt culture th century bc were among the earliest users of iron swords
during the hallstatt period they made swords both in bronze as well as iron with rounded tips
toward the end of the hallstatt period around bc these swords were replaced with short daggers
the la tene culture reintroduced the sword which were very different from the traditional shape and construction of the bronze age and early iron age characterized by a more pointed tip
traditional chinese blades jians are usually of sanmei three plate construction which involved sandwiching a core of hard steel between two plates of softer steel
the central plate protrudes slightly from its surrounding pieces allowing for a sharp edge while the softer spine protects the brittle core
some blades had wumei or five plate construction with two more soft plates being used at the central ridge
bronze jian were often made in a somewhat similar manner in this case an alloy with a high copper content would be used to make a resilient core and spine while the edge would be made from a hightincontent alloy for sharpness and welded onto the rest of the blade
the swordsmiths of china are often credited with the forging technology that was carried to korea and japan allowing swordsmiths in those places to create such weapons as the katana
this technology included folding inserting alloys and differential hardening of the edge which historically has been the most common technique around the world
while the japanese would be more influenced by the chinese dāo singleedged swords of various forms the early japanese swords known as ken are often based on the jian
onesided jians from the tang dynasty provided the basis for various japanese forging styles and techniques
the korean version of the jian is known as the geom or gum and these swords often preserve features found in mingera jian such as openwork pommels and sharply angled tips
korea has a history of swordsmithing dating back  years
citation needed although korea was in close proximity to both japan and china no native systems of swordsmanship and swordmaking developed in korea
korean swords include long swords such as the yeoh do geom and hyup do and curved swords such as samindo
citation needed metal swords of double bladed leaf structure have been found throughout korea dating back to the bronze age
these bronze swords were around  cm in overall length with a short handle

the technology that led to the development of the japanese sword originated in china and was brought to japan by way of korea
the oldest steel swords found in japan date to the fourth or fifth century ad although appearing to be ceremonial in nature samples of these straight blades preserved in the shōsōin were handforged with hardened cutting edges
by the time of the heian period   ad the japanese sword took on its distinctive curved shape as a mounted horseman would have more use for a slashing type of blade as opposed to a thrusting type
these swords were known as tachi
due to the quality of metal found in japan japanese bladesmithing became an extremely rigid precise process involving folding and forgewelding the steel many times over to create a laminated blade
by the time of the kamakura period ad japan was under the rule of a military class and repelling mongol invasions
this became known as the golden era of japanese bladesmithing under emperor toba ii who became a bladesmith himself
after abdicating toba ii summoned japans finest bladesmiths around him in an effort to develop the perfect sword
it was determined that a sword had to be hard in order to maintain a sharp cutting edge yet hard steel is brittle and can shatter under the stress of a heavy blow
swordsmiths in japan found the solution by wrapping a softer lowcarbon steel core such as wrought iron in a jacket of highcarbon steel and then hardening the edge
however under heavy usage the edge would be more prone to chipping than its european counterparts which were typically designed to deal with heavier armor than japanese blades
this was answered by allowing projections of softer steel known as ashi to form in the hardened cutting edge during differential hardening of the blade
the mongol invasions brought with them a need for swords also suited for handtohand combat and the smiths began manufacture of shorter blades to meet this need
it was during the muromachi period that the katana and tantō came into being
by the sixteenth century japanese bladesmithing had become so renowned throughout asia that the japanese turned to large scale manufacturing of swords as an export to china
smiths at sakai also crafted knives for cutting tobacco which had been introduced by the portuguese
the sakai bladesmithing industry received a major boost from the tokugawa shogunate which granted sakai a special seal of approval and enhanced its reputation for quality
the haitorei edict in  banned carrying of swords in public which combined with the decimation of the samurai class caused a heavy decline in the number of swords produced throughout the country
swordmaking was completely banned following world war ii and did not resume until  under heavy restrictions to preserve it solely as an art
in modernday japan a swordsmith is still only allowed to manufacture two swords a month by law for example
as a result many smiths travel to taiwan or china to make extra swords for the export market as foreignmade swords are also illegal in japan
bladesmithing is still practiced in the cities of sakai osaka prefecture and seki gifu prefecture
the germanic migration period peoples also had advanced bladesmithing techniques for their level of technology
migration era smiths would often forgeweld blades of multiple materials and their blades were typically doubleedged and straight
migration era blades were often forged with a hard steel edge wrapped around a pattern welded core
pattern welding was adopted from the neighbouring romans who had employed such technique since the second century ad
bladesmithing was common practice in india during the middle ages
a special type of steel known as wootz or damascus steel was often used in south asia
the term damascus steel can refer to two different types of artefacts
one is the true damascus steel or wootz steel which is a high carbon alloy with tremendous edge retention possibly due to its composition of carbon nanotubes and carbide nanowires with a wavy surface texture originating from the crystalline structure of alloy metals such as tungsten and vanadium elements that occur naturally in iron ore from southern india to the surface during the manufacturing process
this is still in debate as metallurgist john verhoeven at iowa state university believes the nanowires to occur in most steels
the other is a composite structure made by welding together iron and steel to give a visible pattern on the surface called pattern welded steel
although both were referred to as damascus steels true damascus steels were not replicated in europe until 
between the th and th centuries the toledo swordmaking industry enjoyed a great boom to the point where its products came to be regarded as the best in europe
damascus steel was commonly used in the middle east
bladesmithing began declining after the industrial revolution
with improvements in steel production bladesmiths no longer had to forge steel and knives could be machined from flat bars of steel
as cutlery companies moved to mass production of blades and machine tools became more available the art of forging steel began to disappear as knifemakers could grind blades out of existing stock
by the mid th century bladesmithing had been relegated to a cottage industry carried out by a handful of bladesmiths
one of these bladesmiths was william f moran who forged his knives using a coal forge in the manner of a blacksmith using a hammer and anvil to shape the steel
moran began trying to revive the ancient process of forging damascus steel in the late s
however no living bladesmith knew the exact techniques and without a recipe for the process it was in danger of being lost through trial and error he taught himself pattern welding and referred to his end product as damascus steel
in  moran was elected president of the knifemakers guild
the following year he unveiled his damascus knives at the guild show and created a revival of interest in the forged blade and along with the knives he gave away free booklets detailing how he made them to encourage other knifemakers to take up the hammer and anvil
in  he founded the american bladesmith society abs
despite its name this was an international group of knife makers dedicated to preserving the forged blade and educating the public about traditional bladesmithing techniques
the handful of traditional bladesmiths in the s rose to several hundred by 
the basic art and principles of forging a blade has remained similar for thousands of years and the modern bladesmith uses a variety of tools and techniques in order to produce a blade
forges formerly fed by wood coke or coal are still in use but gas forges are becoming the standard
likewise the smiths hammer is being eclipsed by the use of hydraulic forging presses and power hammers
modern bladesmiths use a variety of steels to produce their blades most commonly high carbon steel such as sae  or sae  the  representing the series carbon steels while   and  reflect the carbon content of the steel tool steel such as o a d other tool or high carbon steels or a variety of steels welded in layers commonly referred to as damascus
when forging the blade material is heated to a high temperature or forging temperature in a forge and shaped with a hammer on an anvil to achieve the desired shape often to near final dimension where very little stock removal if any is required to finish
steel can be folded either to form decorative pattern welded steel or to refine raw steel or as the japanese call it tamahagane
grain size is kept at a minimum as grain growth can happen quite easily if the blade material is overheated
swords and longer blades in modern times are often crafted of  carbon spring steel which is not as hard or brittle as a high carbon steel such as  but is more durable and less prone to breakage and therefore more suitable for longer weapons
carbon spring steel is sometimes used for leaf springs in american trucks making it readily available in the us
in europe en is more commonly used
many bladesmiths are able to forge a special type of steel using a technique called pattern welding producing a metal erroneously referred to as damascus steel
modern patternwelded steel can be highly decorative as well as durable if welded in certain ways with proper steels and is often used in custom knife and swordcrafting
bill moran is said to be the father of modern damascus steel
a coppersmith also known as a brazier is a person who makes artifacts from copper and brass
brass is an alloy of copper and zinc
the term redsmith is used for a tinsmith that uses tinsmithing tools and techniques to make copper items
anthropologists believe copper to be the first metal used by humans due to its softness and ease of manipulation
in antiquity coppers durability and resistance to rust or corrosion proved valuable
coppers relationship with man is thought to date back over six thousand years
coppersmith is one of the few trades that have a mention in the bible
copper was particularly worked in england with ores smelted in wales as early as the s
copper was found in great quantities in north america especially montana as well as archaic copper mines near lake superior which was recorded by a jesuit missionary in 
coppersmithing as a trade benefited strongly from the invention of sheet metal rollers
copper sheet was then available in a much more versatile and easy form for creating copper wares
by the s coppersmiths lived in the american colonies but did not have access to much sheet copper due to the british crowns regulation of copper and other goods to the americas
sheet metal production was prohibited in the colonies as well before the american revolution
most coppersmiths can create from a pattern copper wares from a sheet of copper
they can also repair clean and retin copper cookware interiors
some copper smiths make barrels
some coppersmiths will specialize in specific forms or items such as a particular type of biscuit oven or mug or kettle
in the  and s coppersmiths typically had a few apprentices in various stages of learning the trade working together
apprentices would start learning the trade usually around  or  years old
typical duties of a youth in the copper shop would include tasks such as breaking coke or sal ammoniac blocks scouring copper pieces to prepare them for tinning and polishing hammers and tools
in regions where copper is mined like iberia and india there are a number of centers where the coppersmith trade has flourished
these include
notable copper styles in the uk include newlyn in cornwall and keswick in cumbria
coppersmith work started waning in the late s and early s and those in the sheetmetal trade began doing the coppersmiths work the practices used being similar to those in the plumbing trade
coppersmiths in recent years have turned to pipe work not only in copper but also stainless steel and aluminium particularly in the aircraft industry
copper is generally considered to be a soft metal meaning it can be worked without heating
over a period of working the metal in this way it can workharden
this means that the molecules within the copper are compressed and irregular in their arrangement
this causes stress in the metal and eventually cracking the metal along these stress points
in order for the copper to be worked to any extensive degree it must be annealed
this process involves heating the metal and then rapidly cooling it in water
the cooling stage is known as quenching
by heating the copper the molecules in the metal are relaxed and thus able to align themselves in a more uniform fashion
this allows for easier shaping of the metal
in order to keep this uniformity within the metal it is cooled instantly
this prevents the molecules from moving around and causing tension in the structure of the metal
unlike ferrous metals which must be cooled slowly to anneal copper can be cooled slowly in air or quickly by quenching in water
a forge is a type of hearth used for heating metals or the workplace smithy where such a hearth is located
the forge is used by the smith to heat a piece of metal to a temperature where it becomes easier to shape by forging or to the point where work hardening no longer occurs
the metal known as the workpiece is transported to and from the forge using tongs which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithys anvil while the smith works it with a hammer
sometimes such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands the workpiece is transported to the slack tub which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water
however depending on the metal type it may require an oil quench or a salt brine instead many metals require more than plain water hardening
the slack tub also provides water to control the fire in the forge
a forge typically uses bituminous coal industrial coke or charcoal as the fuel to heat metal
the designs of these forges have varied over time but whether the fuel is coal coke or charcoal the basic design has remained the samea forge of this type is essentially a hearth or fireplace designed to allow a fire to be controlled such that metal introduced to the fire may be brought to a malleable state or to bring about other metallurgical effects hardening annealing and tempering as examples
the forge fire in this type of forge is controlled in three ways amount of air the volume of fuel and shape of the fuelfire
over thousands of years of forging these devices have evolved in one form or another as the essential features of this type of forge
tuyere a pipe through which air can be forced into the fire
bellows or blower a means for forcing air into the tuyere
hearth a place where the burning fuel can be contained over or against the tuyere opening
traditionally hearths have been constructed of mudbrick adobe fired brick stone or later constructed of ironduring operation fuel is placed in or on the hearth and ignited
a source of moving air such as a fan or bellows introduces additional air into the fire through the tuyere
with additional air the fire consumes fuel faster and burns hotter and cleaner smoke can be thought of as escaped potential fuel
a blacksmith balances the fuel and air in the fire to suit particular kinds of work
often this involves adjusting and maintaining the shape of the fire
in a typical coal forge a firepot will be centred in a flat hearth
the tuyere will enter the firepot at the bottom
in operation the hot core of the fire will be a ball of burning coke in and above the firepot
the heart of the fire will be surrounded by a layer of hot but not burning coke
around the unburnt coke will be a transitional layer of coal being transformed into coke by the heat of the fire
surrounding all is a ring or horseshoeshaped layer of raw coal usually kept damp and tightly packed to maintain the shape of the fires heart and to keep the coal from burning directly so that it cooks into coke first
if a larger fire is necessary the smith increases the air flowing into the fire as well as feeding and deepening the coke heart
the smith can also adjust the length and width of the fire in such a forge to accommodate different shapes of work
the major variation from the forge and fire just described is a backdraft where there is no fire pot and the tuyere enters the hearth horizontally from the back wall
coke and charcoal may be burned in the same forges that use coal but since there is no need to convert the raw fuel at the heart of the fire as with coal the fire is handled differently
individual smiths and specialized applications have fostered the development of a variety of forges of this type from the coal forge described above to simpler constructions amounting to a hole in the ground with a pipe leading into it
a gas forge typically uses propane or natural gas as the fuel
one common efficient design uses a cylindrical forge chamber and a burner tube mounted at a right angle to the body
the chamber is typically lined with refractory materials such as a hard castable refractory ceramic or a soft ceramic thermal blanket ex kaowool
the burner mixes fuel and air which are ignited at the tip which protrudes a short way into the chamber lining
the air pressure and therefore heat can be increased with a mechanical blower or by taking advantage of the venturi effect
gas forges vary in size and construction from large forges using a big burner with a blower or several atmospheric burners to forges built out of a coffee can utilizing a cheap simple propane torch
a small forge can even be carved out of a single soft firebrick
the primary advantage of a gas forge is the ease of use particularly for a novice
a gas forge is simple to operate compared to coal forges and the fire produced is clean and consistent
they are less versatile as the fire can not be reshaped to accommodate large or unusually shaped pieces
it is also difficult to heat a small section of a piece
a common misconception is that gas forges can not produce enough heat to enable forgewelding but a welldesigned gas forge is hot enough for any task
a finery forge is a waterpowered mill where pig iron is refined into wrought iron
the anvil serves as a workbench to the blacksmith where the metal to be forged is placed
anvils may seem clunky and heavy but they are a highly refined tool carefully shaped to suit a blacksmiths needs
anvils are made of cast or wrought iron with a tool steel face welded on or of a single piece of cast or forged tool steel
some anvils are made of only cast iron and have no tool steel face
these are not real anvils and will not serve a blacksmith as such because they are too soft
a common term for a cast iron anvil is aso or anvil shaped object
the purpose of a tool steel face on an anvil is to provide what some call rebound as well as being hard and not denting easily from misplaced hammer blows
the term rebound means it projects some of the force of the blacksmiths hammer blows back into the metal thus moving more metal at once than if there were no rebound
a good anvil can project anywhere from  to  of the energy back into the workpiece
the flat top called the face is highly polished and usually has two holes but can have more or less depending on the design
the square hole is called the hardy hole where the square shank of the hardy tool fits
there are many different kinds of hardy tools
the smaller hole is called the pritchel hole used as a bolster when punching holes in hot metal or to hold tools similar to how the hardy tool does but for tools that require being able to turn a degree angle such as a holddown tool for when the blacksmiths tongs can not hold a workpiece as securely as it needs to be
on the front of the anvil there is sometimes a horn that is used for bending drawing out steel and many other tasks
between the horn and the anvil face there is often a small area called a step or a cutting table that is used for cutting hot or cold steel with chisels and hot cut tools without harming the anvils face
marks on the face transfer into imperfections in the blacksmiths work
there are many types of hammer used in a blacksmiths workshop but this will name just a few common ones
hammers can range in shape and weight from half an ounce to nearly  pounds depending on the type of work being done with it
hand hammer used by the smith
ballpeen hammer
crosspeen hammer
straightpeen hammer
rounding hammer
sledge hammer used by the striker
chisels are made of high carbon steel
they are hardened and tempered at the cutting edge while the head is left soft so it will not crack when hammered
chisels are of two types hot and cold chisels
the cold chisel is used for cutting cold metals while the hot chisel is for hot metals
usually hot chisels are thinner and therefore can not be substituted with cold chisels
also many smiths shape chisels as to have a simple twisted handle as to resemble a hammer they can be used at a greater distance away from the hot metals
they are very useful and found throughout the world
tongs are used by the blacksmith for holding hot metals securely
the mouths are custom made by the smith in various shapes to suit the gripping of various shapes of metal
it is not uncommon for a blacksmith to own twenty or more pairs of tongs traditionally a smith would start building their collection during the apprenticeship
there are various types of tongs available in the market
flat tong
rivet or ring tong
straight lip fluted tong
gad tong
fullers are forming tools of different shapes used in making grooves or hollows
they are often used in pairs the bottom fuller has a square shank which fits into the hardy hole in the anvil while the top fuller has a handle
the work is placed on the bottom fuller and the top is placed on the work and struck with a hammer
the top fuller is also used for finishing round corners and for stretching or spreading metal
the hardy tool is a tool with a square shank that fits in a hardy hole
there are many different kinds of hardy tools such as the hot cut hardy used for cutting hot metal on the anvil the fuller tool used for drawing out metal and making grooves bending jigs and too many others to list
a slack tub is usually a large container full of water used by a blacksmith to quench hot metal
the slack tub is principally used to cool parts of the work during forging to protect them or keep the metal in one area from spreading for example nearby hammer blows to harden the steel to tend a coal or charcoal forge and simply to cool the work quickly for easy inspection
in bladesmithing and toolmaking the term will usually be changed to a quench tank because oil or brine is used to cool the metal
the term slack is believed to derive from the word slake as in slaking the heat
drop forging is a process used to shape metal into complex shapes by dropping a heavy hammer with a die on its face onto the workpiece
the workpiece is placed into the forge
then the impact of a hammer causes the heated material which is very malleable to conform to the shape of the die and die cavities
typically only one die is needed to completely form the part
extra space between the die faces causes some of the material to be pressed out of the sides forming flash
this acts as a relief valve for the extreme pressure produced by the closing of the die halves and is later trimmed off of the finished part
the equipment used in the drop forming process is commonly known as a power or drop hammer
these may be powered by air hydraulics or mechanics
depending on how the machine is powered the mass of the ram and the drop height the striking force can be anywhere from  to  pounds
the tools that are used dies and punches come in many different shapes and sizes as well as materials
examples of these shapes are flat and vshaped which are used for opendie forging and single or multipleimpression dies used for closed die forging
the designs for the dies have many aspects to them that must be considered
they all must be properly aligned they must be designed so the metal and the flash will flow properly and fill all the grooves and special considerations must be made for supporting webs and ribs and the parting line location
the materials must also be selected carefully
some factors that go into the material selection are cost their ability to harden their ability to withstand high pressures hot abrasion heat cracking and other such things
the most common materials used for the tools are carbon steel and in some cases nickelbased alloys
the materials that are used most commonly in drop forging are aluminium copper nickel mild steel stainless steel and magnesium
mild steel is the best choice and magnesium generally performs poorly as a drop forging material
a goldsmith is a metalworker who specializes in working with gold and other precious metals
nowadays they mainly specialize in jewellerymaking but historically goldsmiths have also made silverware platters goblets decorative and serviceable utensils and ceremonial or religious items
goldsmiths must be skilled in forming metal through filing soldering sawing forging casting and polishing metal
the trade has very often included jewellerymaking skills as well as the very similar skills of the silversmith
traditionally these skills had been passed along through apprenticeships however more recently jewellery arts schools specializing in teaching goldsmithing and a multitude of skills falling under the jewellery arts umbrella are unavailable
many universities and junior colleges also offer goldsmithing silversmithing and metal arts fabrication as a part of their fine arts curriculum
compared to other metals gold is malleable ductile rare and it is the only solid metallic element with a yellow color
it may easily be melted fused and cast without the problems of oxides and gas that are problematic with other metals such as bronzes for example
it is fairly easy to pressure weld wherein similarly to clay two small pieces may be pounded together to make one larger piece
gold is classified as a noble metal because it does not react with most elements
it usually is found in its native form lasting indefinitely without oxidization and tarnishing
gold has been worked by humans in all cultures where the metal is available either indigenously or imported and the history of these activities is extensive
superbly made objects from the ancient cultures of africa asia europe india north america mesoamerica and south america grace museums and collections throughout the world
some pieces date back thousands of years and were made using many techniques that still are used by modern goldsmiths
techniques developed by some of those goldsmiths achieved a skill level that was lost and remained beyond the skills of those who followed even to modern times
researchers attempting to uncover the chemical techniques used by ancient artisans have remarked that their findings confirm that the high level of competence reached by the artists and craftsmen of these ancient periods who produced objects of an artistic quality that could not be bettered in ancient times and has not yet been reached in modern ones
dubious discuss
in medieval europe goldsmiths were organized into guilds and usually were one of the most important and wealthiest of the guilds in a city
the guild kept records of members and the marks they used on their products
these records when they survive are very useful to historians
citation needed goldsmiths often acted as bankers since they dealt in gold and had sufficient security for the safe storage of valuable items though they were usually restrained from lending at interest which was regarded as usury
in the middle ages goldsmithing normally included silversmithing as well but the brass workers and workers in other base metals normally were members of a separate guild since the trades were not allowed to overlap
many jewelers also were goldsmiths
the sunar caste is one of the oldest communities in goldsmithing in india whose superb gold artworks were displayed at the great exhibition of  in london
in india daivadnya brahmins kshatriya sunar are the goldsmith castes
the printmaking technique of engraving developed among goldsmiths in germany around  who had long used the technique on their metal pieces
the notable engravers of the fifteenth century were either goldsmiths such as master e s or the sons of goldsmiths such as martin schongauer and albrecht dürer
a goldsmith might have a wide array of skills and knowledge at their disposal
gold being the most malleable metal of all offers unique opportunities for the worker
in todays world a wide variety of other metals especially platinum alloys also may be used frequently
karat is pure gold and historically was known as fine gold
because it is so soft however  karat gold is rarely used
it is usually alloyed to make it stronger and to create different colors
depending on the metals used to create the alloy the color can change
this alloyed gold is then stamped with the  mark representing the percentage of gold present in the alloy for commercially used gold
the majority of the jewellery is made with this alloy while a smaller part uses lower golddensity alloys to keep jewelry cheaper
the gold may be cast into some item then usually with the lost wax casting process or it may be used to fabricate the work directly in metal
in the latter case the goldsmith will use a variety of tools and machinery including the rolling mill the drawplate and perhaps swage blocks and other forming tools to make the metal into shapes needed to build the intended piece
then parts are fabricated through a wide variety of processes and assembled by soldering
it is a testament to the history and evolution of the trade that those skills have reached an extremely high level of attainment and skill over time
a fine goldsmith can and will work to a tolerance approaching that of precision machinery but largely using only his eyes and hand tools
quite often the goldsmiths job involves the making of mountings for gemstones in which case they often are referred to as jewelers
jeweller however is a term mostly reserved for a person who deals in jewellery buys and sells and not to be confused with a goldsmith silversmith gemologist diamond cutter and diamond setters
a jobbing jeweller is the term for a jeweller who undertakes a small basic amount of jewellery repair and alteration

gunsmiths do modifications and changes to a firearm that may require a very high level of craftsmanship requiring the skills of a toplevel machinist a very skilled woodworker and even an engineer
gunsmiths perform factorylevel repairs and renovations to restore a wellused or deteriorated firearms to new condition
they may make alterations to adapt sporting guns to better fit the individual shooter that may require extensive modifications to the firearms stocks and metal parts
repairs and redesigns may require fabrication and fitting of unavailable parts and assemblies constructed by smiths themselves
gunsmiths may also renew metal finishes or apply decorative carvings or engravings to guns
many gun shops offer gunsmithing service on the premises
gunsmiths may be employed in
to pursue the entirety of this trade a gunsmith must possess skills as a parts fabricator a metalworker or blacksmith a woodworker and an artisan be knowledgeable in shop mathematics ballistics chemistry and materials engineering be knowledgeable in the use and application of a variety of hand power and machinists tools and measuring devices and be capable of working accurately and precisely
those who are self employed in small gunsmith shops must also possess skills as small business operators work effectively with a wide variety of customers and remain abreast of and comply with federal state and local laws ordinances and requirements

due to the great breadth of subject matter to be mastered many gunsmiths specialize in only a few of the skills required of the general gunsmith
alternatively some gunsmiths learn many of the skills of the trade but only apply them to a few weapon types eg only pistols only shotguns only specific brands or models
the primary responsibility of a gunsmith is to ensure that guns work and function safely
gunsmiths accomplish this by always properly observing and demonstrating gun safety in their handling procedures both in their own actions and in the actions of their customers and the people around them
they accomplish that task secondly by inspecting guns to ensure safe mechanical operation
gunsmiths use their indepth knowledge of guns to guide inspections either repairing deficiencies or notifying customers of unsafe conditions and taking steps to prevent catastrophic failures
some of the conditions a gunsmith looks for when inspecting a firearm brought to them for repairs are
this list is not comprehensive
many failure modes are dependent on the particular model of firearm
listed in approximate but not exact order of increasing difficulty
while some gunsmiths are general practitioners in this trade some of the more important specializations are
builds guns to customers specification from raw materials and shelf parts
gunsmiths specializing in custom areas can be called upon by professional targetshooters avid sports shooters or anyone that wants custom attributes added to their firearm to create highly accurate or custom looking firearms
a custom gunsmith also builds highend firearms for hunters and shooters with needs and desires that can not be served by standard catalogued firearms offered by gun manufacturers
they may work in partnership with engravers and other specialized artists to produce unique finishes and decorations not possible on regular massproduced firearms
some highly specialized gunsmiths can complete all firearm modifications without anyone else in the industry helping them
this is likely the most highly skilled of gunsmiths as they are required not only to have proficiency in the other areas of gunsmithing but must also be well educated in firearm finishing and machining in order to manufacture the individual components and even springs before assembly takes place
applies various chemical processes browning bluing parkerization among others to the metal parts of guns to develop corrosion resistant surface layers on the steel
they may also apply case hardening to low carbon steel parts
case hardening is a combined chemical and heattreatment process which introduces carbon into the surfaces of low steel alloys that does not contain sufficient carbon to allow total through heat treatment
this carbon rich surface is then heat treated resulting in a thin very hard surface layer with a tough malleable core
this process can be done solely for the mechanical properties hardness and toughness it imparts or by packing the parts in bone charcoal and other chemicals and heating in a heat treatment furnace for varying time periods it is possible to introduce rich colors into the carbonized surface
this type of case hardening known as color case hardening is prized for its rich mottled blues purples browns and grey tones
it is possible with highly skilled craftsmen using highly proprietary processes to control the hues and patterns so closely that one familiar with high grade custom firearms can usually recognize the maker of another shooters firearm solely by the colors and patterns on its parts an important distinction on extremely costly firearms of the highest grade
typically its use is usually restricted to receivers rarely barrels
although providing corrosion resistance the colored surface layers are subject to wear and may also fade with time
antique firearms for sale frequently note the specific percentage of the factory original case coloring remaining on the receiver and lockplates
renewing this color case hardening to the specific patterns of the firearm when it was new has become an important subarea of the gunsmithing field
carves gun stocks from wood usually walnut although birch maple and apple wood among others are frequently seen
fits stocks to the metal parts of the gun receiver and barrel as well as to customers body dimensions
with custom made shotguns the fit to the individual shooter is vital as the shot clouds impact is largely determined by the way the stock fits the shooter
very high grade firearms may have stocks fashioned from very costly blanks mostly of one of the walnut varieties specially chosen for its rare and highly figured grain
the fashioning of high end gunstocks calls for an extremely high level of skill and craftsmanship as the finished product must be pleasing aesthetically fit the shooting customer like an orthopedic device all the while having the ability to withstand high levels of recoil from the firing of many thousands of rounds
wood gunstocks may be fashioned with automated machinery for production firearms while high end gunstocks are hand made using saws chisels gouges rasps and files
the surfaces are then finished by sanding scraping staining oiling or lacquering
this specialization is frequently combined with that of the stockmaker uses checkering tools to create an ornate pattern of small raised diamonds in the wood surfaces which are to be gripped
the checkering tools are in effect tiny saws designed to leave a vshaped groove of approximately  to  degrees in the surface of the wooden gunstock
special checkering tools consisting of two saw blades in parallel are used to set the spacing usually between  and  lines per inch  mm to  mm line width
the area to be checkered is covered by one set of such grooves parallel to each other
a second set of parallel grooves is then executed across the first set at approximately a degree angle leaving the area covered with small pointed diamonds
the edges of the checkered area are frequently ornamented with simple basrelief wood carving frequently variations on the fleurdelis
uses handgravers or diesinkers chisels to cut designs or pictures into the metal surfaces of the gun primarily the receiver
the firearms engraver must first be a highly gifted and capable artist that can first compose the desired design freehand on paper
in many cases the customer must be consulted and must approve the design
in some cases the engraving may incorporate a favorite scene a revered hunting dog or even family members and residences
the engraver must have a through knowledge of human and animal anatomy perspective botany and composition
the smallness and geometry of the parts must also be considered and harmony between all these factors must artistically agree
these designs must then be cut freehand into the tough hardened steel surfaces of the firearm
pneumatically driven engraving systems such as the gravermeister developed by grs tools may be used to replace or supplement handpowered engraving but the guiding of these powered tools is still provided by the artist
other metals especially gold and silver may be inlaid and engraved to further the design
designs usually consist of elaborate scrollwork based upon acanthus leaves or vines or may be of purely abstract spirals
before the development of corrosion resistant surface treatments for steel gun surfaces were engraved to retain more oil to prevent rust
in modern usage guns are engraved purely for artistic reasons
top grade engraving is very expensive but well executed tastefully designed engraving always adds significantly to the value of quality firearms
many of the worlds foremost art museums have highly decorated firearms in their collections because of the high artistic merit and craftsmanship of their engraved chiseled and carved decoration
many books exist on the subject of highly decorated firearms with detailed illustrations showing their art in steel
specializes in work on pistols and revolvers
pistolsmiths should be proficient in a range of skills such as woodworking checkering machining metal finishing and metalworking
they must have an excellent understanding of the mechanical characteristics and function of the guns they work on
often a pistolsmith is called on for extensive customization of a handgun making it better suited for its intended purpose
a good example of this is changing the factory sights for new front and rear sights more suited to the purposes of the user
a wide variety is available as aftermarket parts
target pistols usually start out as standard models but receive extensive reworking by skilled pistolsmiths resulting in a firearm that is capable of much greater accuracy than the standard versions of the same arm
a more advanced job a pistolsmith may called on to perform is to construct a completely hand fitted target arm using a serial numbered frame as the base as required by law with the rest of the parts supplied with excess metal in certain areas by specialist manufacturers so the pistolsmith can fit these parts together to exacting tolerances
using these methods the pistolsmith can build highly accurate firearms that greatly exceed the usual accuracy of standard models of the same model
some gunsmiths used their experience and skills to become smalloperation manufacturers specializing in making only a few types of gun parts for sale to other gunsmiths and gunmakers
some of the more important part categories are
in general gunsmiths develop and expand their skills through years of experience
some common ways to get started in gunsmithing include
basic machinist skills while not limited to gunsmithing are of great help to aspiring gunsmiths
these may include both machine and handtool operations such as metal turning drilling filing stoning or polishing
news of the most highly skilled and talented gunsmiths typically spreads by word of mouth based on the quality of their work
the very best and most talented gunsmiths command premium prices for their services and may have waiting lists booked for several years in advance
in many countries of the world the possession and ownership of firearms by civilians is highly restricted or outright illegal
the practice of gunsmithing is therefore typically restricted licensed or regulated
in some circumstances the only legal firearmsrelated repairs are by individuals trained and employed by the military or police
these individuals are known as armorers
typically their skill level is usually far below that of the private or artisan gunsmith
where the gunsmith frequently has to design manufacture and fit parts ranging from small internal parts and assemblies the armorer usually only has to replace standard interchangeable parts belonging to only one type series or family of militaryrelated firearms
they typically are furnished a large inventory of standard parts that are known to wear and cause malfunctions in the weapons they will encounter and they are simply trained to replace these items until satisfactory function is restored
in the regions where ownership is permitted but limited or restricted to those individuals able to afford the costs of acquiring and owning a firearm the firearms that are allowed tend to be fewer in number and possess levels of craftsmanship and decoration that approach that of an art object instead of simply a device to expel a projectile
gunsmithing in these regions as in germany and britain is concerned with the handcrafting of completely custommade firearms tailored to the requirements of the owner
germany has a tradition of hunting but this is generally a complicated undertaking that limits its participation
firearms possession is highly regulated by the police and most hunters own only one long gun and perhaps a single pistol
one of germanys more distinctive firearm developments is the drilling a multibarrel gun that may incorporate a doublebarreled shotgun above with a highpowered singleshot barrel below
these typically have highly sophisticated breech mechanisms precise fitting and are handengraved by artists specializing in this work
the stocks are usually fitted to the individual and are very expensive wood with highly figured grain
firearms ownership in italy is regulated by the italian government but private ownership of various types and numbers of firearms is allowed after proper vetting of the prospective purchaser
italy has a hunting tradition dating back several centuries
it is the location of some of the finest upland game bird hunting in the world
italy also has a rich history of gunmaking and gunsmithing going back several hundred years with the production of matchlock flintlock and caplock rifles and pistols
the city of brescia italy and specifically its suburb of gardone val trompia is historical home to a number of firearm manufacturers and gunsmiths
italy is noted as one of the worlds leading manufacturing centers of custommade highly crafted double shotguns
the city of gardone is the home of several manufacturing firms that sell their products worldwide with pietro beretta founded in  being the largest and best known
italian shotguns are noted for their precise fitting their precision craftsmanship and the higher grades feature exquisite hand engraving
the brescia area has several training facilities for the education of apprentices gunsmiths for the crafting of high grade shotguns and rifles
there is also a training achedemy for engravers and many freelance engravers are also located in this area
during the tokugawa period in japan starting in the th century the government imposed very restrictive controls on the small number of gunsmiths in the nation thereby ensuring the almost total prohibition of firearms
japan in the postwar period has had gun regulation which is strict in principle
gun licensing is required and is heavily regulated by the national police agency of japan
the weapons law begins by stating no one shall possess a firearm or firearms or a sword or swords and very few exceptions are allowed
the united kingdom makes some of the most expensive handcrafted firearms in the world despite a highly restrictive ownership environment
but as the gunsmiths patrons are usually well able to afford the high ownership fees and stringent storage requirements the price of the arm is only secondary
decoration of these arms typically doublebarreled shotguns is on par with the plates used to mint currency and is priced about the same
several of the other european countries follow this pattern as in italy where the art of the gunsmith has also reached a high level of sophistication
these craftsmen may specialize as in the case of the gun engraver and stockmaker
generally these craftsmen serve long apprenticeships under master gunmakers
they may also be members of guilds which set up apprentice programmes often sponsored by the governments in these countries as highly crafted firearms are important items in the export trade supervise training and conduct exams where the journeymanlevel gunsmiths submit sample firearms of their own work in order to be admitted the guild membership
many of these can only be regarded as gunmakers instead of gunsmiths and do repairs only on the very highest grade firearms
many are able to make a substantial livelihood
in the united states the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf is the primary federal agency overseeing all legitimate businesses that deal with firearms with the exception of firearms made before january   or muzzle loading firearms
the atf is in charge of the licensing of all legitimate firearms dealers and gunsmiths in the us that engage in business with the public
the issuance of a federal firearms license ffl involves a thorough background investigation and an inspection of the gunsmiths premises by an agent of the atf
the atf requires all gunsmiths to record all repairs noting the serial numbers type of firearm caliber or gauge and full particulars of the owner with an accepted form of identification id to be presented and recorded
gunsmiths are required to maintain these records in a permanent nonalterable form
the atf inspects the premises of all licensed gunsmiths with unannounced visits at periodic intervals
the atf is granted the power by the us government to initiate the prosecution in us federal court of gunsmiths that wilfully omit or violate these provisions
punishment can range from losing their ffl and therefore the privilege to engage in any firearmsrelated business to fines and in severe cases such as conspiring to supply the criminal element with black market weaponry imprisonment in a federal prison
gunsmiths who lack sophisticated machine shop capabilities must understand the law
enlisting an unlicensed no ffl machine shop to create gun receivers can be illegal
other common parts such as grips barrels triggers sights magazines recoil springs and stocks can be manufactured freely but all receiver development work does require licensing
generally gunsmiths can not undertake the repair of a firearm they believe is illegally held by a person not permitted to own a firearm a convicted felon for instance or one that otherwise violates the laws where the owner resides
the ownership of firearms in the us is governed by local laws
these laws and regulations vary greatly from state to state county to county city to city and potentially across all jurisdictional lines
additionally modifications to firearms made by gunsmiths are restricted as well
the atf specifies what modifications are permitted or not permitted and to which firearms that may or may not be applied
these laws may also vary by

locksmithing is the science and art of making and defeating locks
locksmithing is a traditional trade and in many countries requires completion of an apprenticeship
the level of formal education legally required varies from country to country from none at all to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer to a full diploma from an engineering college such as in australia in addition to time spent working as an apprentice
a lock is a mechanism that secures buildings rooms cabinets objects or other storage facilities
a smith is a metalworker who shapes metal pieces often using a forge or mould into useful objects or to be part of a more complex structure
thus locksmithing as its name implies is the assembly and designing of locks and their respective keys by hand
most locksmiths use automatic and manual cutting tools to mold keys most are power tools having battery or mains electricity as their power source
locks have been constructed for over  years initially out of wood and later out of metal
historically locksmiths would make the entire lock working for hours hand cutting screws and doing much filework
lock designs became significantly more complicated in the th century and locksmiths often specialized in repairing or designing locks
after the rise of cheap mass production the vast majority of locks are repaired by swapping of parts or likeforlike replacement or upgraded to modern massproduction items
until more recently safes and strongboxes were the exceptions to this and to this day large vaults are custom designed and built at great cost as the cost of this is lower than the very limited scope for mass production would allow and the risk of a copy being obtained and defeated as practice is removedalthough fitting of keys to replace lost keys to automobiles and homes and the changing of keys for homes and businesses to maintain security are still an important part of locksmithing locksmiths today are primarily involved in the installation of higher quality locksets and the design implementation and management of keying and key control systems
most locksmiths also do electronic lock servicing such as making keys for transponderequipped vehicles and the implementation and application of access control systems protecting individuals and assets for many large institutionsin terms of physical security a locksmiths work frequently involves making a determination of the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommending and implementing appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create security layers which exceed the reasonable gain to an intruder or attacker
the more different security layers are implemented the more the requirement for additional skills and knowledge and tools to defeat them all
but because each layer comes at an expense to the customer the application of appropriate levels without exceeding reasonable costs to the customer is often very important and requires a skilled and knowledgeable locksmith to determine
in australia prospective locksmiths are required to take a technical and further education tafe course in locksmithing completion of which leads to issuance of a level  australian qualifications framework certificate and complete an apprenticeship
they must also pass a criminal records check certifying that they are not currently wanted by the police
apprenticeships can last one to four years
course requirements are variable there is a minimal requirements version that requires fewer total training units and a fuller version that teaches more advanced skills but takes more time to complete
apprenticeship and course availability vary by state or territory
in ireland licensing for locksmiths was introduced in  with locksmiths having to obtain a private security authority license
in the uk there is no current government regulation for locksmithing so effectively anyone can trade and operate as a locksmith with no skill or knowledge of the industry
fifteen states in the united states require licensure for locksmithis as described in the table below
locksmiths may be commercial working out of a storefront mobile working out of a vehicle institutional employed by an institution or investigatory forensic locksmiths or may specialize in one aspect of the skill such as an automotive lock specialist a master key system specialist or a safe technician
many are also security consultants but not every security consultant has the skills and knowledge of a locksmith
locksmiths are frequently certified in specific skill areas or to a level of skill within the trade
this is separate from certificates of completion of training courses
in determining skill levels certifications from manufacturers or locksmith associations are usually more valid criteria than certificates of completion
some locksmiths decide to call themselves master locksmiths whether they are fully trained or not and some training certificates appear quite authoritative
the majority of locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware not just locking mechanisms
this includes door closers door hinges electric strikes frame repairs and other door hardware
the issue of full disclosure was first raised in the context of locksmithing in a thcentury controversy regarding whether weaknesses in lock systems should be kept secret in the locksmithing community or revealed to the public
according to a c hobbs
a commercial and in some respects a social doubt has been started within the last year or two whether or not it is right to discuss so openly the security or insecurity of locks
many wellmeaning persons suppose that the discussion respecting the means for baffling the supposed safety of locks offers a premium for dishonesty by showing others how to be dishonest
this is a fallacy
rogues are very keen in their profession and know already much more than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery
rogues knew a good deal about lockpicking long before locksmiths discussed it among themselves as they have lately done
if a lock let it have been made in whatever country or by whatever maker is not so inviolable as it has hitherto been deemed to be surely it is to the interest of honest persons to know this fact because the dishonest are tolerably certain to apply the knowledge practically and the spread of the knowledge is necessary to give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance
it can not be too earnestly urged that an acquaintance with real facts will in the end be better for all parties
some time ago when the reading public was alarmed at being told how london milk is adulterated timid persons deprecated the exposure on the plea that it would give instructions in the art of adulterating milk a vain fear milkmen knew all about it before whether they practised it or not and the exposure only taught purchasers the necessity of a little scrutiny and caution leaving them to obey this necessity or not as they pleased
a metalsmith or simply smith is a craftsperson fashioning useful items for example tools kitchenware tableware jewellery and weapons out of various metals
 smithing is one of the oldest metalworking occupations
shaping metal with a hammer forging is the archetypical component of smithing
often the hammering is done while the metal is hot having been heated in a forge
smithing can also involve the other aspects of metalworking such as refining metals from their ores traditionally done by smelting casting it into shapes founding and filing to shape and size
the prevalence of metalworking in the culture of recent centuries has led smith and its equivalents in various languages to be a common occupational surname german schmidt or schmied portuguese ferreiro ferreira french lefèvre spanish herrero italian fabbri ferrari ferrero ukrainian koval etc
as a suffix smith connotes a meaning of a specialized craftsperson for example wordsmith and tunesmith are nouns synonymous with writer or songwriter respectively
in preindustrialized times smiths held high or special social standing since they supplied the metal tools needed for farming especially the plough and warfare
a metalsmith is one who works with or has the knowledge and the capacity of working with all metals
types of smiths include
the ancient traditional tool of the smith is a forge or smithy which is a furnace designed to allow compressed air through a bellows to superheat the inside allowing for efficient melting soldering and annealing of metals
today this tool is still widely used by blacksmiths as it was traditionally
the term metalsmith often refers to artisans and craftpersons who practice their craft in many different metals including gold copper and silver
jewelers often refer to their craft as metalsmithing and many universities offer degree programs in metalsmithing jewelry enameling and blacksmithing under the auspices of their fine arts programs
machinists are metalsmiths who produce highprecision parts and tools
the most advanced of these tools cnc machines are computer controlled and largely automated

a silversmith is a metalworker who crafts objects from silver
the terms silversmith and goldsmith are not exactly synonyms as the techniques training history and guilds are or were largely the same but the end product may vary greatly as may the scale of objects created
in the ancient near east the value of silver to gold being less allowed a silversmith to produce objects and store these as stock
ogden states that according to an edict written by diocletian in  ad a silversmith was able to charge      or  denarii for material produce per roman pound
at that time guilds of silversmiths formed to arbitrate disputes protect its members welfare and educate the public of the tradesilversmiths in medieval europe and england formed guilds and transmitted their tools and techniques to new generations via the apprentice tradition
silver working guilds often maintained consistency and upheld standards at the expense of innovation
beginning in the th century artisans emigrated to america and experienced fewer restrictions
as a result silver working was one of the trades that helped to inaugurate the technological and industrial history of the united states silverworking shift to industrialization
very exquisite and distinctly designed silverware that goes by the name of swami silver emerged from the stable of watchmaker turned silversmith p orr and sons in the south indian city of madras now chennai during the british rule in 
the beta israel known more widely as the falasha of ethiopia were known for their silversmithing skills
silversmiths saw or cut specific shapes from sterling and fine silver sheet metal and bar stock and then use hammers to form the metal over anvils and stakes
silver is hammered cold at room temperature
as the metal is hammered bent and worked it workhardens
annealing is the heattreatment used to make the metal soft again
if metal is workhardened and not annealed occasionally the metal will crack and weaken the work
silversmiths can use casting techniques to create knobs handles and feet for the hollowware they are making
after forming and casting the various pieces may be assembled by soldering and riveting
during most of their history silversmiths used charcoal or coke fired forges and lungpowered blowpipes for soldering and annealing
modern silversmiths commonly use gas burning torches as heat sources
a newer method is laser beam welding
silversmiths may also work with copper and brass especially when making practice pieces due to those materials having similar working properties and being more affordable than silver
although jewelers also work in silver and gold and many of the techniques for working precious metals overlap the trades of jeweler and silversmith have distinct histories
chainmaking and gemsetting are common practices of jewelers that are not usually considered aspects of silversmiths
the tradition of making iron plate armor was interrupted sometime after the th century
silversmithing and goldsmithing by contrast have an unbroken tradition going back many millennia
the techniques used to make armor today whether for movies or for historical recreation groups are an amalgam of silversmith forming techniques and blacksmith ironhandling techniques
a whitesmith is a metalworker who does finishing work on iron and steel such as filing lathing burnishing or polishing
the term also refers to a person who works with white or lightcoloured metals and is sometimes used as a synonym for tinsmith

the first known description of whitesmith is from  
the iron thus prepared is used both by the white and blacksmiths of this county according as the condition of their wares require it being forged by the former into sithes reapinghooks axes hatchets bills being ground at the blademills to a bright edge they have given this sort of artisans that make them the name of whitesmithswhitesmithing developed as a speciality of blacksmithing in the s when extra time was given to filing and polishing certain products
in  the trade was described by isaac taylor
the business of the smith comprises two branches that of the blacksmith and that of the whitesmith
from the hands of the former come large and coarse articles as horseshoes ploughshares chains iron doors for safes c the whitesmith manufactures articles of neater and more delicate form as locks keys carpenters tools c the blacksmith does little with his iron till he has softened it in the fire of his forge which is a kind of hearth raised to a convenient height from the ground
a large pair of double bellows pours a strong stream of air to the centre of the forge where he has a fire made of small coals or coal dust wetted to make them give a more intense heat
into this fire he thrusts his iron and working his bellows brings it to a white heat in which state it is so soft that a little hammering will reduce it to any required shape
the whitesmith also has a forge but he depends less upon it than upon his files
the articles he manufactures are so numerous that almost every one constitutes a distinct employment one set of men being confined to the making of locks and keys another set to the making of files a third to carpenters tools and so onthe principal manual skills of the whitesmith were in filing and turning the use of lathes
using crosscut files the whitesmith could achieve a flat smooth finish on iron or steel products where the less skilled might only achieve a convex effect
for very large items the whitesmith might even file when red hot using a twoperson operated float file
this profession is also related to a bell hanger and locksmith as they perform much file work
in great britain this type of worker was affiliated with a union
the amalgamated society of whitesmiths was founded in 
it was renamed the amalgamated society of whitesmiths locksmiths bellhangers domestic engineers art metal workers and general iron fitters in  the amalgamated society of whitesmiths locksmiths bellhangers domestic engineers art metal workers and general iron and pipe fitters in  and the amalgamated society of whitesmiths domestic engineers and general pipe fitters in 
in  it merged with the amalgamated society of kitchen range stove grate gas stove hot water art metal and other smiths and fitters connected with the above trades the amalgamated society of kitchen range hot water and general fitters and the birmingham society of hot water and steam engineers to form the national union of operative heating and domestic engineers whitesmiths and general iron workers
james watt employed a whitesmith in the s when working on his experimental steam engine
the first cylinder was made by this whitesmith using hammered iron and solder
although this technique proved insufficient when this whitesmith died soon after watt wrote to john roebuck greatly lamenting the loss of his white iron man
with the industrial revolution in the same way that many blacksmiths became specialised as farriers making horse shoes so many whitesmiths became lorimers making spurs stirrups bridle bits and buckles
typically whitesmiths made products that either required a decorative finish such as fire grates or that needed coldworking such as screws and lathed machine parts
